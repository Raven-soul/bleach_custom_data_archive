                            В мире «Блича» магия работает совсем по-другому. Магия не извлекается из переплетения, а скорее создается заклинания с сильной Рейрёку (духовной силой). Ближайшее сходство — это то, как колдуны творят магию.
            
                            Заклинания традиционно классифицируются по уровням. Кидо оцениваются по шкале от 1 до 99, причем заклинания последнего являются самыми мощными и наиболее трудными для исполнения. Чтобы использовать кидо, синигами должен произнести определенное заклинание, которое часто бывает длинным и требует нескольких секунд, чтобы произнести заклинание.
                
                            Сила заклинания зависит от силы пользователя, поскольку даже заклинание низкого уровня может быть совершенно разрушительным, если его использует синигами высокого класса.
                
                            Существует три основных типа кидо: Бакудо (Связывающий), Хадо (Путь разрушения) и Кайдо (Исцеляющий Кайдо).
                
                            ### Очки заклинаний
                            В этой книге используется вариант системы очков заклинаний для произнесения заклинаний. В этом варианте стоимость каждого заклинания зависит от его уровня. В таблице «Стоимость очков заклинаний» суммирована стоимость в очках заклинаний слотов с 1-го по 9-й уровень.
                
                            ##### Стоимость очков заклинаний
                            | Уровень слота заклинаний | Стоимость очков |
                            |:---:|:----:|
                            | Заговор | 1 |
                            | 1 | 2 |
                            | 2 | 3 |
                            | 3 | 5 |
                            | 4 | 6 |
                            | 5 | 7 |
                            | 6 | 9 |
                            | 7 | 10 |
                            | 8 | 11 |
                            | 9 | 13 |
                
                            ### Запретное кидо
                            Существует также классификация кидо, которую Общество душ считает незаконным. Использование таких заклинаний обычно приводит к длительному тюремному заключению или еще хуже. Заклинания кидо обычно подпадают под этот класс – это те, которые включают манипулирование пространством, временем и кидо, приносящее себя в жертву.
                
                            ### Список заклинаний синигами
                            Список заклинаний синигами разделен на следующие три категории:
                
                            **Бакудо.** Это широкая категория защитных заклинаний, которые блокируют/отражают атаки или обездвиживают врагов. Они могут показаться тонкими, но при правильном использовании эти заклинания могут дать своим пользователям тактическое преимущество.
                
                            **Хадо.** Наступательные заклинания, наносящие прямой урон противнику. Их эффективность различается в зависимости от пользователя.
                
                            **Кайдо.** Широкая категория служебных заклинаний. Большинство из них состоят из заклинаний, которые либо лечат, либо укрепляют тело.

                        ## Spell Descriptions
                        The spells presented here are new spells, adjusted spells (excluding level changes) and other spells not present in the Players Handbook; all organized in alphabetical order.

If the creature has more than one head, the globe of air appears around only one of its heads (which is all the creature needs to avoid suffocation, assuming that all its heads share the same respiratory system).
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create two additional globes of fresh air for each slot level above 2nd.

                        You can attempt to pierce the Saketsu and Hakusui of a creature and seal their spiritual power. You make a melee spell attack against a creature you can see within range. On a success the target takes 14d6 necrotic damage and loses access to any magical abilities or effects it has such as spellcasting, class abilities and magical racial abilities.
            
                        This spell does not affect plants or constructs.
            
                        At the beginning of each day, the target can make a Constitution saving throw and continue to make saving throws until they either succeed three times or fail three times, whichever comes first. On a third failure, the creature dies. On a third success, this spell ends on that creature.
            
                        #### Antimagic Ray

                        A shimmering beam of energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target is treated as if they were within an Antimagic Field for the duration of this spell.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you create two additional rays.

                        You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic. Until the spell ends, you can’t cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:
            
                        * You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.
                        * You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons.
                        * When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra 2d12 force damage.
                        * You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.
                        * You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.
                        * You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.
            
                        Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

                        #### Blade of Disaster
                        *9th-level Conjuration* [Hadō]
                        ___

                        \pagebreakNum
            
                        As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and then make up to two melee spell attacks with it again.

                        - **Range:** Self
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        A small stroke of lightning forming a line 20 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose.

                        #### Close Wound
                        *Cantrip Evocation* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** Touch
                        - **Components:** V, S

                        A creature touched by this spell can spend one additional Hit Die when you reach 5th level (2), 11th level (3), and 17th level (4).
            
                        #### Contingent Resurrection
                        *10th-level Necromancy* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 hour
                        - **Range:** Touch
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
                        - **Duration:**  Until dispelled
                        ___
                        Once cast, the spell remains quiescent and does not activate until the trigger conditions have been met (but each day it remains untriggered, it uses up spell points, even if the character cast it on another creature). Once triggered, the spell is expended. If the subject is killed (the trigger), they are restored to life and complete health 1 minute later, so long as even a tiny bit of the target remains for contingent resurrection to act upon. A radiant flash of light shines from the remaining part of the target, illuminating everything within 20 feet. The creature is restored to full hit points, vigor, and health.
            
                        However, the subject permanently loses 1 point of Constitution if the subject was 1st level or had 9 or less hit dice. Contingent resurrection does not work on a creature that has died of old age.
            
                        #### Create Homunculus
                        *6th-level Transmutation* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 hour
                        - **Range:** Touch
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (clay, ash, and madrake root, all of which the spell consumes, and a jewel-encrusted dagger worth at least 1,000 gp)
                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        While speaking an intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking 2d4 piercing damage that can’t be reduced in any way.
            
                        You then drip your blood on the spell’s other components and touch them, transforming them into a special construct called a homunculus.
            
                        The statistics of the homunculus are in the Monster Manual. It is your faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus’s hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point, and the change to your and the homunculus’s hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum can’t be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus’s death.
            
                        You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.

                        #### Crown of Stars
                        *7th-level Evocation*
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** Self
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:** 1 hour
                        ___
                        Seven star-like motes of light appear and orbit your head until the spell ends. You can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended. The spell ends early if you expend the last mote.
            
                        If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to three motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of motes created increases by two for each slot level above 7th.

                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
                        ___
                        You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.
            
                        **Creature.** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.
            
                        On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.
            
                        **Object.** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.
            
                        If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.
            
                        You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

                        A translucent wall of force springs existence protecting you against harm. When an attack, spell or ability is made against you, the wall blocks it, causing the attack to miss or the spell to have no effect on you.

                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 150 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a shard of onyx and a drop of the caster’s blood, both of which the spell consumes)
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        This spell creates a sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere can have a radius of up to 40 feet.
            
                        The area within this sphere is filled with magical darkness and crushing gravitational force.
            
                        For the duration, the spell’s area is difficult terrain. A creature with darkvision can’t see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
            
                        Any creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
            
                        A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.

                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a sunburst pendant worth at least 100 gp)
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range. Until the spell ends, a 30-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light glimmers there. This light is sunlight.
            
                        When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder.
            
                        If you’re within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.

                        - **Duration:**  24 Hours
                        ___
                        Raging winds and a hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 2 mile radius centered on a point within range. Everything in the storm takes 1 point of cold damage each round. A successful Reflex save results in no damage, but the save must be repeated each round. The intense cold freezes water out of the air, causing constant snowfall and wind. The snow and wind produce a blizzard effect within the Area.
            
                        Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        You reach into the mind of one creature you can see and force it to make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature automatically succeeds if it is immune to being frightened. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the spell ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
            
                        Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, spell, or other ability it’s using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
                        ___
                        This spell converts magical energy damage into healing power. You touch a willing creature rendering it immune to either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage.
            
                        The next time the target is subjected to magical damage of the chosen type, they instead regain hit points equal to half of the damage that would be dealt. This spell ends early on a creature once they regained a number of hit points equal to 2 x your character level.
            
                        #### Enervation

                        ___
                        A tendril of inky darkness reaches out from you, touching a creature you can see within range to drain life from it. 
                        The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 2d8 necrotic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage, and until the spell ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal 4d8 necrotic damage to the target. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything
            
                        else, if the target is ever outside the spell’s range, or if the target has total cover from you.
            
                        Whenever the spell deals damage to a target, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage the target takes.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

                        When you need to make sure something gets done, you can’t rely on vague promises, sworn oaths, or binding contracts of employment. When you cast this spell, choose one humanoid within range that can see and hear you, and that can understand you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed in this way, it undertakes to perform any services or activities you ask of it in a friendly manner, to the best of its ability.
            
                        You can set the creature new tasks when a previous task is completed, or if you decide to end its current task. If the service or activity might cause harm to the creature, or if it conflicts with the creature’s normal activities and desires, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect. This save is made with advantage if you or your companions are fighting the creature. If the activity would result in certain death for the creature, the spell ends.
            
                        When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

                        You impart latent luck to yourself or one willing creature you can see within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can
            
                        dismiss this spell on itself to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

                        You make a ranged weapon attack with your Heilig Bogen using the material component as ammunition (which the spell consumes). On a successful hit, the Seele Schneider stops in mid-air just before hitting the target and surrounds them in a 10-foot cube barrier of high density Reishi for the duration. 
            
                        Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.
            
                        During the duration, as an action, you cause the barrier to collapse in on itself crushing the target within and then exploding in an enormous explosion. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 3d6 force damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one.

                        Those creatures then remember that you actually said the words you speak as the verbal component of the spell.

                        When you cast the spell, you hurl the coin that is the spell’s material component to any spot within range. The coin lights up as if under the effect of a light spell. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the coin must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be distracted for the duration. While distracted, a creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and initiative rolls.

                        You clasp your hands together, as your chanting, five small yellow orbs emerge from your hands and circle your head. Raising your clasped hands above your head and slapping downwards the orbs are sent into the ground. A bright light flashes above a target you can see within range and five pentagonal pillars linked by chains crash down on the target. Each pillar is 10 feet tall and 3 feet thick. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw.
            
                        On a failed save they are prone and grappled for the duration.  Additionally, the target is barred from teleportation or interplanar travel and can't perform somatic components from spells.
            
                        On each of the creatures turns it can spend an action to make a Strength saving throw, ending the spell on a success.

                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        Choose a spell of 7th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you or an ally. You cast that spell (called the contingent spell) as part of casting greater contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. The target describes that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a greater contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when the target is engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
            
                        When the circumstance is met for the first time for the contingent spell, the target may have the spell take effect. If they do, greater contingency ends. If not, the spell persists until the circumstance is met again.
            
                        The contingent spell takes effect only on the target, even if it can normally target others.
            
                        A creature can only have one contingency spell active on them at a time. Also, contingency ends on the target if its material component is ever not on their person.

                        * You gain darkvision with a range of 120 feet.
                        * You make Strength-based attack rolls with advantage.

                        - **Duration:** 24 hours
                        ___
                        You cause a temple to shimmer into existence in an area you can see within range. The temple is a cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. The area within the temple is removed from existence and removes the space from all outsider's consciousness. When you cast this spell you can choose any number of creatures that are not affected by this spell. Additionally, while this spell is active, you can perform a 1 minute ritual and expend a 3rd level or higher spell slot to add or remove creatures affected by the spell or not.
            
                        The temple matches any surrounding buildings or terrain and appears ordinary. All creatures subconsciously avoid the area and the thought of approaching the temple does not occur.
            
                        In addition, sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the temple, and creatures within can’t be targeted by divination spells.
            
                        The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple’s interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple’s exterior. It can’t be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.
            
                        Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

                        *8th-level Illusion* [Hadō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 120 feet
                        - **Components:** S
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        By gathering threads of shadow material from the Shadowfell, you create a Huge shadowy dragon in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The illusion lasts for the spell’s duration and occupies its space, as if it were a creature.
            
                        When the illusion appears, any of your enemies that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
            
                        As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 60 feet. At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space. When you create the dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 7d6 damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
            
                        The illusion is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to create it, but attacks miss it automatically, it succeeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. A creature that uses an action to examine the dragon can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and has advantage on saving throws against its breath.

                        ___
                        So long as you maintain concentration on this spell, you cannot be killed or incapacitated by effects, spells or attacks that reduce you to 0 or fewer hit points. If you take such damage, you can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the damage taken. If you fail this save, you die or fall unconscious (as appropriate). If this save is successful, you are still alive and conscious, with 1 hit point remaining.
            
                        This spell provides no protection against effects that slay you without dealing hit point damage.
            
                        After you attempt three Constitution saving throws to avoid death or unconsciousness by this spell, this spell automatically ends.

                        You touch an object that weighs no more than 10 pounds and cause it to become magically fixed in place. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can move the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute.
            
                        If the object is fixed in the air, it can hold up to 4,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the object to fall. Otherwise, a creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can move the object up to 10 feet.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or 5th level, the DC to move the object increases by 5, it can carry up to 8,000 pounds of weight, and the duration increases to 24 hours. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the DC to move the object increases by 10, it can carry up to 20,000 pounds of weight, and the effect is permanent until dispelled.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

                        ___
                        By sacrificing a piece of your own body you create a massive pillar of energy the shape of a Katana tip. A cylinder that is 200 feet tall and 50 feet wide appears on a point centered on you. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw; you have disadvantage on this saving throw. A target takes 100 + your Hit Die in fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
            
                        The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

                        You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.
            
                        This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.

                        Using the black powder, upon a solid surface you draw a circle with four quadrants and symbols in each one. The circle glows and symbols begin to flicker and information is revealed to you.
            
                        Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature's location as well as

                        coordinates of it's location, as long as that creature is within the same plane. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement. If the creature is on a different plane, you only get the name of the plane they're on and the spell ends.

                        ___
                        You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.
            
                        The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.
            
                        Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

                        From your outstretched hand a number of roman numeral-inscribed constructs shoot out into the ground, several towering columns of Reishi, shaped like the Quincy Cross, erupt upwards in a circular formation around you. 
            
                        A 40-foot radius 60-foot high column centered on you springs into existence. Any creature (other than you) that enters the area for the first time, moves within the area for the first time, starts or ends their turn within the area, must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 8d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

                        *9th-level Abjuration* [Bakudō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
                        - **Range:** 30 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)
                        - **Duration:**  Until dispelled
                        ___
                        You create magical restraints to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again.
            
                        While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.
            
                        When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.
            
                        **Burial.** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.
            
                        The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.
            
                        **Chaining.** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.
            
                        **Hedged Prison.** The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.
            
                        **Minimus Containment.** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.
            
                        **Slumber.** The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.
            
                        **Ending the Spell.** During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.
            
                        The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.
            
                        A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.
            
                        \pagebreakNum
            
                        You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 7th.

                        This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.
            
                        The destination you choose must be familiar to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you.

                        ___
                        You create a 20-foot-cube of destructive gravitational force centered on a point you can see within range. For the spell’s duration, the cube and any space within 30 feet of it are difficult terrain, and nonmagical objects fully inside the cube are destroyed if they aren’t being worn or carried.
            
                        A creature that starts its turn within the cube takes 8d10 force damage and is restrained until it is no longer in the cube. If the sphere is in the air, the restrained creature hovers inside the sphere.
            
                        A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending this restrained condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach.

                        You create nine black holes with purple oultines that surround a creature within range you can see. The black holes emit immense gravitational energy on the target.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

                        Name or describe a person, place, or object and you choose Legend or Lore.
            
                        If you choose lore the spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant and common known information about the thing you named. 
            
                        If you choose legend the spell brings to your mind current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. The information you learn is accurate but might be shrouded in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word of their land on the lips."

You take up to 6d8 necrotic damage, which can’t be reduced in any way, and one creature of your choice that you can see within range regains a number of hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage you take.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

                        Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness.
            
                        Nonmagical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can’t illuminate the area.

                        The gravity in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range increases for a moment. Each creature in the sphere on the turn when you cast the spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 force damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its speed.
            
                        Until the start of your next turn, any object that isn’t being worn or carried in the sphere requires a successful Strength check against your spell save DC to pick up or move.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

                        The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.
            
                        If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.

                        You impart two motes of luck on up to 5 creatures you can see within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can expend a mote of luck to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can expend a mote to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.
            
                        If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

                        The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.

                        Choose up to 4 willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
            
                        When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

                        - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
                        ___
                        You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on a
            
                        Wisdom saving throw to resist the transformation. An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.
            
                        Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or half the target’s level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.
            
                        Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points can’t be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has
            
                        no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.
            
                        The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It can’t speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech.
            
                        The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

                        You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell that only it perceives. One creature you can see within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. The target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being charmed. On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target's space appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spell's duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.

                        - **Duration:** Instantaneous
                        ___
                        A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground of your choice that you can see within range. The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.
            
                        The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress’s outer wall.
            
                        A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.
            
                        A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell.
            
                        The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM’s discretion.
            
                        After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.
            
                        Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.

                        You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target’s location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage, and it can’t take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell’s other effects.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

                        - **Duration:** 1 hour
                        ___
                        You address allies, staff, or innocent bystanders to exhort and inspire them to greatness, whether they have anything to get excited about or not. Choose up to five creatures within range that can hear you. For the duration, each affected creature gains 5 temporary hit points and has advantage on Wisdom saving throws. If an affected creature is hit by an attack, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes. Once an affected creature loses the temporary hit points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the temporary hit points increase by 5 for each slot level above 3rd.

                        ___

                        - **Components:** V, M (a broken bone & a square of black silk)
                        - **Duration:** Instantaneous
                        ___
                        You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a zombie at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the zombie are in the Monster Manual.
            
                        If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn’t make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.

                        Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell or spell-like effect of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

                        Uttering an incantation, you draw on the magic of the Lower Planes or Upper Planes (your choice) to transform yourself. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:
            
                        * You are immune to fire and poison damage (Lower Planes) or radiant and necrotic damage (Upper Planes).

                        * You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that lets you attack more than once when you take the Attack action on your turn.
            
                        #### Peripety
                        *10th-level Abjuration* [Bakudō]

                        ___
                        This spell allows you to make certain spells permanent. Choose an active spell within range. That spell must meet the following requirements to be affected:
            
                        * The spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer.
                        * You know the spell and are able to cast it. If you don't, the material components required are doubled.
                        * The spell is 7th level or lower.
                        * The spell cannot have targeted more than one creature, but can have an area that affects more than one creature
            
                        The affected spell then gains the following traits:
            
                        * The duration is changed to "Until dispelled."
                        * If the spells duration would end if triggered, it continues to persist until dispelled.
                        * If the spell would be affected by Dispel Magic or similar, instead of the spell ending, Permanency ends.
            
                        This spell and affected spells can still be subjected to antimagic fields.

                        - **Range:** 60 feet

                        You create a field of silvery light that surrounds a creature of your choice within range (you can choose yourself). The field sheds dim light out to 5 feet. While surrounded by the field, a creature gains the following benefits:
            
                        **Cover.** The creature has half cover.
            
                        **Damage Resistance.** The creature has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison damage.
            
                        **Evasion.** If the creature is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the creature instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
            
                        As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the field to another creature within 60 feet of the field.
            
                        #### Power Word Pain
                        *7th-level Enchantment* [Hadō]

                        ___
                        You speak a word of power that causes waves of intense pain to assail one creature you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to crippling pain. Otherwise, the spell has no effect on it. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being charmed.
            
                        While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.
            
                        A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.

If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell’s target even if you can’t see it. If the named target isn’t within range, the lance dissipates without effect.
            
                        The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7d6 psychic damage and is incapacitated until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t incapacitated.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

                        You create intense pressure, unleash it in a 30-foot cone, and decide whether the pressure pulls or pushes creatures and objects. Each creature in that cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. And every creature that fails the save is either pulled 15 feet toward you or pushed 15 feet away from you, depending on the choice you made for the spell.
            
                        In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the cone are likewise pulled or pushed 15 feet.

These columns then turn into bows of reishi. These bows have a range of 30 feet and deal 2d8 radiant damage.
            
                        During the duration, you can spend an action to make a ranged spell attack for each bow against a creature within the circle.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius increases by 5 feet and you create an additional bow.

                        This spell summons a swirling thunderstorm at a point you can see within range that rains fire rather than raindrops down a two-mile radius. Everything in the flaming deluge takes 1 point of fire damage each round. A successful Reflex save results in no damage, but the save must be repeated each round. Unless the ground is exceedingly damp, all vegetation is eventually blackened and destroyed, leaving behind a barren wasteland similar to the aftermath of a grass or forest fire. The fiery storm is stationary and not affected by any wind or weather, unless its from a wish spell or 10th level spell.

                        ___
                        You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of destructive gravitational force centered on a point you can see within range. For the spell’s duration, the sphere and any space within 100 feet of it are difficult terrain, and nonmagical objects fully inside the sphere are destroyed if they aren’t being worn or carried.
            
                        When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, unsecured objects within 100 feet of the sphere are pulled toward the sphere’s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.
            
                        A creature that starts its turn within 100 feet of the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the sphere’s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.

                        A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending this restrained condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is annihilated, along with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.

                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        You shatter the barriers between realities and timelines, thrusting a creature into turmoil and madness. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it can’t take reactions until the spell ends. The affected target must also roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns; the number rolled determines what happens to the target, as shown on the Reality Break Effects table.
            
                        At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.
            
                        | d10  | Effect |
                        |:---:|:-----------|
                        |  1-2  | Vision of the Far Realm. The target takes 6d12 psychic damage, and it is stunned until the end of the turn. |
                        |  3-5  | Rending Rift. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
                        |  6-8  | Wormhole. The target is teleported, along with everything it is wearing and carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. The target also takes 10d12 force damage and is knocked prone. |
                        |  9 - 10  | Chill of the Dark Void. The target takes 10d12 cold damage, and it is blinded until the end of the turn. |
            
                        #### Reincarnate

                        You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.
            
                        The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's appearance to change. The GM rolls a d6 on a 1-3 the creature's appearance completely changes, on a 4-6 they retain their previous appearance.
            
                        The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences and retains the capabilities it had in its original form.

                        ___
                        You point your finger at a target you can see within range. Sparks of yellow energy spark form you finger generating six thin, wide beams of light that slam into the targets midsection holding them in place.
            
                        The target must make a Strength saving throw, on a failure they are restrained for the duration.
            
                        If the creature is currently under the effects of Bakudo #4 Hainawa, the target is instead incapacitated and you do not need to concentrate on this spell.

On each of the creatures turns, it can spend an action to make an additional Charisma saving throw, on a success ending the spell.
            
                        #### Screen
                        *9th-level Illusion* [Bakudō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
                        - **Range:** 30 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  24 hours
                        ___
                        This spell creates a powerful protective illusion in a 30-foot-cube area you can see within range or up to 7 creatures you choose within range. The chosen area or creatures are protected by divination effects and direct observation.
            
                        When casting this spell, you can dicate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area. For example, you could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. Or that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible. Sights, sounds, touch, texture and temperature are created appropriate for the illusion. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.
            
                        Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. If a spell would attempt to locate an affected creature, or object on one of those creatures, you can choose to have the spell fail or see the image stated by you with no save allowed. Additionally, any sensors creatured by such spells become visible within the area.
            
                        Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

                        If this bonus to your AC would cause the attack to be unsuccessful, and the attack was a melee attack, the attacker is pushed back 10 feet away.

It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 2d8 psychic damage on a hit and has the finesse, light, and thrown properties (range 20/60).

                        If you drop the weapon or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear in your hand.

                        Flame-like shadows wreathe your body until the spell ends, causing you to become heavily obscured to others. The shadows turn dim light within 10 feet of you into darkness, and bright light in the same area to dim light.
            
                        Until the spell ends, you have resistance to radiant damage. In addition, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, the shadows lash out at that creature, dealing it 2d8 necrotic damage.

                        A bright crimson orb forms in your palm. The orb remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The orb sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.
            
                        You can also attack with the orb, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the orb at a point you choose within range, it then blossoms with a loud roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

                        ___
                        Shijū no Saimon is a barrier formed by four castings of this spell, each time choosing one of the following barriers listed below. When you arrange the following barriers as three walls and Hōyoku no Jōmon as the roof, a cube is formed enclosing the area. When the barrier is created, you choose Defensive or Offensive. Each wall will apply its listed effect to the interior of the barrier.
            
                        **Ryūbi no Jōmon.** You create multiple pillars, each one being five feet wide, 50 feet tall and 5 feet thick, forming a gigantic shield or door-like barrier on a point within range. The barrier is 50 feet wide, 100 feet tall and 20 feet thick. Each pillar has an AC of 10 and 20 hit points per inch of thickness.
            
                        *Defensive.* Friendly creatures regain the maximum number of hit points from any healing.

                        **Borrow Experience.** You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul’s life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don’t use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.
            
                        **Eyes of the Dead.** You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you’re currently on.

Whether the saving throw is successful or not, the target is unaware of the attempted intrusion.

                        As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.

                        ___
                        You draw runes upon your arms and hands, as you outstretch both arms in front of you a glowing rectangular box forms in front of you and root-like extensions glow and extend out into the aether.
            
                        Choose a number of creatures equal to your spell casting score (minimum 4) that you are familiar with. You can instantaneously share up to 30 words with the chosen creatures through the link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating with. The spell enables a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your words and take in the scope of any sensory messages you send to it.
            
                        #### Teppūsatsu
                        *10-level Evocation* [Hadō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 round
                        - **Range:** Self
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        With a chopping motion you create an aura shaped as a head of a dragon which blows a powerful wind from its mouth in a 60-foot cone. Everything in the cone must make a Strength saving throw or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage, 10d6 piercing damage and 10d6 slashing damage, half as much on a successful saving throw. 
            
                        Additionally, any creature or unattended objects that fails it's saving throw is pushed back at a rate of 30 feet per round, until they're out of the area, taking 5d6 bludgeoning damage, 5d6 piercing damage and 5d6 slashing damage. On each of it's turn the creature can make an additional saving throw, on a success they are no longer pushed back.

                        *7th-level Necromancy* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a spool of platinum cord worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes)
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
                        ___
                        Two creatures you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw, with disadvantage if they are within 30 feet of each other. Either creature can willingly fail the save. If either save succeeds, the spell has no effect.
            
                        If both saves fail, the creatures are magically linked for the duration, regardless of the distance between them. When damage is dealt to one of them, the same damage is dealt to the other one. If hit points are restored to one of them, the same number of hit points are restored to the other one. If either of the tethered creatures is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends on both. If the spell ends on one creature, it ends on both.
            
                        #### Time Ravage
                        *9th-level Necromancy* [Hadō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 90 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (an hourglass filled with diamond dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        You target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical form through the devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save fails, the target also ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before it dies of old age. In this aged state, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its walking speed is halved. Only the wish spell or the greater restoration cast with a 9th-level spell slot can end these effects and restore the target to its previous age.
            
                        #### Tiny Servant
                        *4th-level Transmutation* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
                        - **Range:** Touch
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  8 hours
                        ___
                        You touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that isn’t attached to another object or a surface and isn’t being carried by another creature. The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points. See Tiny Servant for its statistics.
            
                        As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take
            
                        and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures.
            
                        Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.
            
                        When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 3rd.
            
                        #### #73 Tozanshō
                        *7th-level Evocation* [Bakudō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 100 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)
                        - **Duration:**  1 hour
                        - **Incantation:**  Words
                        ___
                        An immobile, opaque, light-blue, prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.
            
                        The prison in the shape of a inverted-pyramid, each four sides base 20 feet wide and a height of 40 feet.
            
                        When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.
            
                        A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends
            
                        into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
            
                        This spell can't be dispelled by dispel magic. You can use an action to dismiss this spell early.

                        - **Duration:**  5 minutes
                        ___
                        Your body surges with god-like arcane power. For the duration you gain the following benefits:
            
                        * You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.
                        * All of your ability scores become 20.
                        * You gain a flying speed of 100 feet.
                        * You gain resistance to all damage.

                        * You have advantage on saving throws.
            
                        Although this spell grants you immense power, it comes at a horrific price. You gain these benefits by using up all of your reiryoku. When the spell ends, you are instantly slain and your body disintegrates into nothing. This effect cannot be prevented by any means.

                        *3rd-level Conjuration* [Bakudō]
                        ___

                        ___
                        You conjure a blue ball of energy at a point of your choice within range. Ropes shoot out from the ball anchoring to nearby solid masses (such as walls, buildings, or trees) and the ball expands into a 10-foot radius elastic-like cushion.
            
                        This cushion can hold up to 1000 pounds of weight before breaking. Any creatures or objects that fall into this cushion negates any falling damage.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the weight the cusion can support increases by 1000 pounds and the cushion itself increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

                        Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal or if there is a conductive medium between you and the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.
            
                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

                        You use a Gintō to create a large blast, which cushions the impact of a fall. At the end of a fall, you takes 1 point of bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fell instead of the normal 1d6. Additionally, you do not land prone.
