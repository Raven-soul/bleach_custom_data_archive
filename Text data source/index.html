                            Третий отряд вращается вокруг искусства и культуры. Это подразделение также отвечает за связь Сейрейтея. Раньше эта ответственность была частью обязанностей 9-го отряда, однако, когда Кенсей Мугурума вернулся в качестве капитана и возродил отряд коммандос Мугурума, он передал эти обязанности тому, кто, по его мнению, был гораздо более подходящим; Капитан Роджуро «Роза» Оторибаши из 3-го отряда. Под руководством Роуз компания "Seireitei Communication" процветала и превратилась из группы, выпускающей журналы, в полноценную производственную студию.

Второстепенные обязанности — записывать и сохранять искусство и культуру Общества душ. Последней обязанностью является студия Seireitei Communication.

                            ### Seireitei Communication

Каждое отделение имеет свою полную команду членов и контролируется младшими офицерами, обычно с 3 по 8 званиями. Вице-капитан обеспечивает сохранение искусства и культуры и обеспечивает актуальность опубликованных материалов. В то время как капитан курирует весь отряд.

                            \columnbreak

                            ### Вступление в 4-й отряд

                            Во время вашего пребывания в Академии Син'о вас могли найти в этом подразделении либо из-за вашего миролюбивого характера, либо ваши навыки были больше для оказания поддержки, чем для боя, или, может быть, вы решили, что ваши навыки лучше использовать для сообщества, чем для ведения боя, насилия.

                            ### Предыстория: член 4-го отряда

                            Ремонтируйте постройки, оставшиеся после предыдущей войны, ныряйте в горящие здания, чтобы спасти ребенка, охраняйте караваны с припасами и оказывайте первую помощь, когда вокруг бушует война; это лишь несколько примеров ситуаций, с которыми приходится иметь дело Четвертому отяду.

                            **Навыки:** Выберите два из следующих: легкая атлетика, история, медицина, восприятие.

                            **Экипировка:** Черный косодэ с вышитым на внутренней стороне знаком отличия вашего отряда.

                            #### Особенность: Подгородские тропы

                            Вы знаете скрытые, подземные и эзотерические тропы, которые вы можете использовать, чтобы обойти толпу, препятствия и наблюдения, перемещаясь по городу. Когда вы не в бою, вы и ваши спутники, которых вы возглавляете, можете перемещаться между любыми двумя точками города в два раза быстрее, чем обычно позволяет ваша скорость. Эти пути иногда таят в себе опасность, и их безопасность не гарантируется.

                            Вы получаете дополнительные преимущества в зависимости от вашей станции.

                            **Координированная станция помощи.** Вы и ваши спутники можете найти место, где можно спрятаться или отдохнуть, на любом пункте помощи в городе, если только вы не докажете, что представляете для них опасность. Сотрудники поста защитят вас от закона или кого-либо еще, кто вас ищет, но при этом они не будут рисковать своей жизнью. Кроме того, как член отряда вы можете получать бесплатное лечение и уход на посту, однако вы должны предоставить любые материальные компоненты, необходимые для заклинаний.

                            **Координированная станция снабжения.** Вы знаете, где и у кого можно получить любое сырье, оружие или оборудование. Обычно эта информация поступает от отряда, библиотеки, независимого ученого или другого ученого человека, существа или фракции. Знание того, где можно найти товар, не дает вам автоматически возможности его приобрести; вам может потребоваться предложить взятки, услуги или другие стимулы, чтобы побудить людей раскрыть свой товар.

                            Ваш DM может постановить, что искомый вами товар спрятан в недоступном месте или его просто невозможно найти. Для раскрытия глубочайших тайн мультивселенной может потребоваться приключение или даже целая кампания.

                            **Скоординированная пожарная часть.** Вы можете найти место, где можно спрятаться, отдохнуть или восстановить силы среди простолюдинов, если только вы не показали, что представляете для них опасность. Они защитят вас от закона или кого-либо еще, кто вас ищет, но не будут рисковать ради вас своей жизнью. Кроме того, они могут предоставлять информацию, сплетни и указания о местонахождении информации в этом районе.

                            **Координированный пункт уборки.** У вас есть ключи от входа практически в любое здание. Хотя это не значит, что у вас есть разрешение на вход. Однако если вы злоупотребите этой привилегией, у вас могут возникнуть серьезные проблемы с начальством и даже быть лишенным должности.

                        * You're interested in uncovering mysteries as an investigator.
                        * You like playing lawful characters with depth.

                        ### Joining the 6th Division

                        During your time at the Shin'ō Academy you were drawn to the 6th divisions sense of justice, or upholding and enforcing the law is something important to you. Maybe your skills in Bakudō were so great the 6th division tried to recruit you as an arrestor.

                        ### Background: 6th Division Member

                        Patrolling districts, issuing citations, diffusing hostile situations, engaging and combating criminals are only a few situations you will face as a 6th division member. 

                        **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from the following. Athletics, Acrobatics, Investigation, Insight or Intimidation.

                        #### Feature: Legal Authority

                        You have the authority to enforce the laws of Soul Society, and that status inspires a certain amount of respect and even fear in the populace. People mind their manners in your presence and avoid drawing your attention; they assume you have the right to be wherever you are.

                        Showing your SPD badge gets you an audience with anyone you want to talk to (though it might cause more problems than it solves when you’re dealing with incorrigible lawbreakers). If you abuse this privilege, though, you can get in serious trouble with your superiors and even be stripped of your position.

Whether defending off waves of invaders, or to be deployed. The Captain-Commander then held a meeting and asked the captains for one of them to volunteer their division for this role. Without giving any other captain time to consider, Captain Tetsuzaemon volunteered his division.

                        ### Army Reserve

                        All the members of the 7th division constantly train, as they must be vigilante and ready to deploy at a moments notice. They have many garrisons scattered across the Soul Society and the Human Realm.

                        With the 7th division being mostly male, the 8th Division is predominately female, due to the previous Captains recruitment priorities. This division embodies femininity, strength, elegance, sophistication and discipline.

                        During times of peace after the war, the rudimentary monetary system was in shambles. Loan sharks began to rise and gain great power and influence. Many conflicts started to arise and at one point gangs were a much more larger threat than a hollow incursion. With this problem in mind the Captain-Commander appointed the 8th Division to handle this problem, thus the Seireitei Central Bank was formed.

                        ### Duties of the 8th Division

                        The 8th division functions as Soul Societies central bank. They promote the health of the economy, conduct monetary policy, supervise and regulate banks, maintain financial stability, mint new coins when needed, and ensures the Gotei 13 receive their funding. 

                        ### Seireitei Central Bank

                        The SCB is divided into three departments that work together. Each one headed by lieutenant, 2nd seated officer or 3rd seated officer.

                        The first branch is the Operations Branch. This is the bulk of the division which consists of bank tellers, clerks, marketing representatives, internal auditors, branch managers and loan officers. These individuals handle the most prominent job duties the division is responsible for.

                        The second department is the Minting Department. They manufacture the coins used for currency. 

                        The third department is the Financial Research Department, which consists of economists, financial researchers, financial analysts and bank examiners.

                        Then there is the SCB Council, which consists of the Captain as the head of the council, the lieutenant, the 2nd and 3rd seated officers.

                        Your DM might rule that the funding you seek is too much, would require multiple investors, or your venture is too outlandish for any savvy business person to invest in.

                        The 10th division is one of the most welcoming divisions among the Gotei 13. Those who wish to constantly refine their skills and learn will find that opportunity here. 

                        Previously, Naruki City was under the jurisdiction of the 10th division, but after the war many roles, and duties were shuffled rearranged or consolidated. That city was consolidated under the 5th divisions duties. 

                        With Central 46 focusing more on governing Soul Society less focused was placed on the Academy. The Captain-Commander then nominated the 10th division to assist with managing the school.

                        ### Duties of the 10th Division

                        The primary duty of the 10th division is to govern the Shin'ō Academy. The 10th division ensures the academy is responsive to the values, beliefs and priorities of the Central 46 and Soul Society. They are responsible for staffing the academy, protecting it, providing support for students and setting the curriculum.

                        An additional role of the 10th division is to scout out and recruit souls to take the Shinigami Aptitude Test and increase the numbers of the Gotei 13.

                        ### Shin'ō Academy
                        The Shinōreijutsuin (Spiritual Arts Academy), now just called the Shinigami Academy, was an institution founded by Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto over 2,000 years ago. 

                        The Academy is a sprawling, multiple story building with architecture similar to that of Seireitei. It has an open courtyard, many classrooms, dormitories and practice areas for Zanjutsu, Hakuda, Hohō, and Kidō. The commandment all Shinigami are taught at the Academy is *"Do not seek beauty in battle. Do not seek virtue in death. Do not make the mistake of considering only your own life. If you wish to protect that which you must protect, slice the enemy you must defeat from behind."*

                        The Academy does not teach students to fight for the sake of their superiors or family. Instead they're taught that a Shinigami should give their life to protect their friends and humanity.

                        #### Uniform
                        The uniform of the Academy is similar to the standard Shinigami shihakushō uniform, but with a different color scheme. The women's style consists of a red shitagi (under shirt), a white kosode (shirt) with red stripes, red hakama (trousers), white socks and sandals.

                        For the male version of the uniform, the red is replaced with blue. There is a circular symbol on both breasts of the outer shirt. This appears to be the emblem of the Academy.

                        #### Admission
                        Applicants to the academy must pass an entrance exam in order to be admitted, and must demonstrate that they have some Reiatsu. The entrance exam is open to any and all who wish to apply, resulting in a wide range of individuals of all ages joining.

                        The social classes of the applicants range from nobles and residents of the more hospitable districts of Rukongai to its more barbaric outer regions. The results of the entrance exam are used to divide up the successful applicants into different classes, with those who obtain the highest grades being placed in the first class.

                        At the start of the academic year, there is a welcoming ceremony for the new students.

                        #### Curriculum
                        The Academy's curriculum is taught over six years, though exceptionally gifted students have been known to graduate from the academy in less time than this. In addition to a more general education, the pupils are taught how to control and make use of their Reiatsu, as well as the four major Shinigami combat forms: Hakuda, Hohō, Kidō, and Zanjutsu. Students also learn how to perform Soul Burials, how to communicate with the spirit of their Zanpakutō, and are prepared for the general duties of a Shinigami. Upon completing the Academy's curriculum, a student will then apply to join a division of the Gotei 13.

                        The 11th Division is a direct-combat Division with a specialization in swords-only combat, forgoing the other Shinigami arts and thereby being one of the most specialized divisions in the Gotei 13. As such, it is common practice for members to be carry their Zanpakutō at all times. Since the rise to captain status of the current Kenpachi, an unofficial rule has been added that says to be a true member of the Eleventh Division, one's Zanpakutō must be a melee-type.

                        The division's doctrine of dominating in battle is what appeals to its members; they believe that fighting is what makes life worth living. This is what separates the 11th Division from the others and makes them the strongest division. Everyone in the 11th Division are highly skilled in fighting. They believe if they are going to die anyway, they have to go down fighting gloriously.

                        The division is also set up so that to become the captain of the Eleventh, the candidate must do so through the third method of becoming a captain, killing the previous captain in front of 200 members of the Division.

                        ### Duties of the 11th Division

                        After the war, Zaraki expressed his disappointment and irritation on the amount of casualties the Gotei 13 suffered. He took it upon himself to "properly" teach Zanjutsu to the Gotei 13 members. Though his methods are severe and intense, the results have allowed him to continue. Although after a certain incident with a cocky student losing a limb, Zaraki was only allowed to personally instruct "Advanced Prodigy Pupils;" almost nobody has achieved this pseudo rank, for their own good.

                        Their first role is conducting weekly Zanjutsu drills for all Gotei members seated 5 and below to keep their swordsmanship sharp at all times.

                        Their second role is providing all of the Zanjutsu instructors and the Zanjutsu portion of the curriculum for the academy.

                        ### Zaraki Corps

                        The Zaraki Corps is a special operations force of the Gotei 13. This group consists of the Captain, lieutenant and seats three and four.

                        Additionally, they host a grand tournament once a year for **all** Gotei 13 members and non-shinigami to test their might and skills. With the finalist winning some grand prize, usually money, or the chance to take on the Captain to take his role and the title of Kenpachi. Everyone so far has taken the money. However, Byakuya did enter the tournament once just to challenge Kenpachi, though the Captain-Commander suggested he take the money, for the safety of the attendants and frankly, Soul Society.

                        The 13th division like the 2nd division, 10th division and 12th division has had separate entities merged together. The Kidō Corps became part of the 13th division and it's duties broadened and strengthened. The division now regulates anything Kidō within Soul Society.

                        ### Duties of the 13th Division

                        The 13th division is the primary source for kidō instructors and kidō curriculum for the academy. They're also where one would go to further study and research kidō. Would be students aspiring to become kidō masters or create new kidō will find the resources and guidance to do so here.

                        Their second duty is regulating the usage of kidō. They dictate which kidō should be taught, studied, researched, restricted, or forbidden.

                        ### Kidō Corps

                        The Kidō Corps is a group of specialists presiding over spiritual law. Much like the 2nd division its operations are executed in absolute secrecy.

                        The Kidō Corps have three main known functions. The first is investigating and prosecuting kidō related crimes, and establishing laws regarding kidō.

                        The second is releasing the Sōkyoku seal during executions.

                        The third is opening the Senkaimon. The Senkaimon is the gate used to travel between Soul Society and the Human Realm, and is the only official and safe way to enter and leave Soul Society. Soul Society has only one permanent Senkaimon, which takes the form of a giant gate situated within a large courtyard atop a large tower. Travel through the Senkaimon is heavily regulated, and can only officially be opened by the members of the Kidō Corps. A black winged insect, the Jigokuchō, which only Shinigami are permitted to carry, is needed to pass through it.

                        Upon arriving and leaving from the Human World, the Senkaimon can appear almost anywhere. When it appears in this fashion, the Senkaimon takes the form of a traditional Japanese waiting room entered through a Shōji. It can be opened by using a Zanpakutō as a key. The method requires simply placing the Zanpakutō in front of the user and inserting it into the spacial area one wants the Senkaimon to appear before turning the sword like a key while declaring "Kaijō!" (unlocking). Intruders can pass through the Senkaimon, but the lack of a Jigokuchō forces intruders to pass through the Dangai.

                        # Royal Guard

                        The Royal Guard, also known as the Zero Division, is dedicated to the protection of the Soul King, the Royal Family, and the Soul King Palace. The Royal Guard is a special organization that performs services for the Royal Family. It has a considerable amount of fighting, organizational, and executive power compared to other divisions.

                        Since serving the royal family is the primary purpose of the Royal Guard, they do not interfere in Gotei 13's affairs and the defense of Soul Society, even against major threats like Aizen and his Arrancar. They are known to do whatever is required by order of the Soul King.

                        The Royal Guard's authority supersedes the authority of all within Soul Society. Each member of the Royal Guard have had the power of the Ōken imparted onto their bones by the Soul King. They also each have a city of their own at the Soul King Palace.

                        The Royal Guard commonly stays within the Soul King Palace, but when they do travel, their preferred method of transportation is a huge pillar called the Tenchūren (Heavenly Pillar-Palanquin). This pillar enters from the inner dimension and lands with significant force upon its arrival. The Tenchūren, however, does not have the ability to return to the palace on its own, and relies on Kūkaku Shiba's cannon to launch it back.  Additionally, there is the Chōkaimon (Super World Gate), but it can only be opened by syncing the arrival and departure times. The final and least used form of transportation is the interdimensional stairs that lead to the Seireitei, though it will take anywhere from half a day to a week of travel to get there.

                        Like the divisions of the Gotei 13, the Royal Guard has a unique symbol that represents the division's primary role, which is in its case based upon the Winter Daphne (Jinchōge). This symbol is placed inside the Gotei 13 symbol of a rhombus to form the division's complete insignia, which is displayed upon each member's haori.

                        ### History

                        Due to their status as a secret organization, the history and very existence of the Royal Guard is not commonly known. 

                        Many believed them to be a myth up until they arrived when the Quincy invaded.

                        ### Structure

                        The Royal Guard is known to promote former captains of the Gotei 13 to their ranks. The Royal Guard has no soldiers, and it only has 5 members, all of which are former captains. Their total power far surpasses the power of all the 13 Divisions together.

                        All the members of the Royal Guard were Shinigami acknowledged by the Soul King to have made significant contributions to the history of Soul Society.

                        \columnbreak

                        ### Notable Members & Contributions

                        **Ichibē Hyōsube:** Leader of the Zero Division, known as the *Monk Who Calls the Real Name*, his contribution was that he was the first to chose the names for everything in Soul Society, including Zanpakutō, Shikai and Bankai. He also became the first Shinigami whose Zanpakutō gained an evolved form, which was known as Shinuchi.

                        **Tenjirō Kirinji:** Divine General of the East and 1st officer, known as the *Hot Spring Demon*, his contribution was the creation of most Kaidō and various healing springs.

                        **Kirio Hikifune:** Divine General of the South and 2nd officer, known as the *Ruler of Grain*, her contribution was the creation of the Artificial Soul.

                        **Ōetsu Nimaiya:** Divine General of the West and 3rd officer, known as the *God of the Sword*, his contribution was the creation of the Zanpakutō.

                        **Senjumaru Shutara:** Divine General of the North and 4th officer, known as the *Great Weave Guard*, her contribution was the Shutara Scale as well as the clothing the Gotei 13 use.

                        #### Divine General
                        *Prerequisites: Rank 5, Renown 25 or higher and must have provided a great contribution to Soul Society*

                        As a Royal Guard member you are bestowed the Oken, which allows access to and from the Royal Palace. Once per long rest you can cast Plane Shift with no material components. You may expend two hit die to cast this spell an additional time.

                        Additionally, you are granted your own city within the Royal Kingdom to preside over as you see fit.

                        # The Wandenreich

                        After losing the war with the Shinigami 1,000 years ago, the Quincy escaped from the Human World into the Seireitei, the place they believed to be the most unguarded. In doing so, they used Reishi to create space in the "shadows". This is what was called the Wandenreich, the "Invisible Empire". Their plan was to use the abundant Reishi that was only to be found in Soul Society as the source of their power, so they hid and waited for 1,000 years while gathering their power.

                        Sometime after the defeat of Sōsuke Aizen, the Wandenreich conquered Hueco Mundo, capturing Tier Harribel in the process. In addition, they conscripted many Arrancar into their service and killed many Hollows.
                        With the defeat of Ywach and most of their fighting force the Wandenreich was left in disarray.

                        ### Structure

                        Much like the Gotei 13, the Wandenreich has a rigid and defined hierarchy.

                        #### Emperor
                        The leader and undisputed ruler of the Wandenreich who has absolute control and say.

                        #### Sternritter
                        The Star Knights is a group of elite Quincy combatants led by the Sternritter Grandmaster. Several Sternritter are appointed as the emporer's elite guards, known as the Schutzstaffel (Imperial Guards), led by the Schutzstaffel Grandmaster.

                        #### Jagdarmee
                        The Hunting Corps is a hunting unit which, in the wake of Hueco Mundo's conquest by the Wandenreich, is entrusted with capturing Arrancar to serve the empire. The Jagdarmee is separated into numbered groups. The Executive Hunting Captain being the leader of the first Jagdarmee.

                        #### Soldat
                        The soldiers of the Wandenreich that make up most of the army. They can defeat low-ranked Shinigami with ease.

                        ### Rank and Renown

                        By gaining renown as a member of the Wandenreich, you can ascend through an ordered series of ranks within the faction. Promotion always requires the approval of a superior officer. It is a reward for services rendered to the orgranization, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.

                        In addition, certain positions become available to you when both your renown and your character level reach certain thresholds.

                        \columnbreak

                        #### Rank 1: Soldat (Soldier)

                        *Prerequisite: Renown 1 or higher*

                        At this rank you are part of a platoon of soldiers. You embark on routine missions and low threat missions.

                        You salary allows you to sustain a Modest lifestyle.

                        #### Rank 2: Feldwebel (Sergeant)

                        *Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher*

                        At this rank, you gain some authority over a few Soldat. When you undertake a mission on the faction’s behalf that requires military strength, a squad of 1d4 soldiers (your DM has the stats) accompanies and assists you for the duration of the mission.

                        #### Jäger (Hunter) [Special Role]

                        *Prerequisite: Rank 1, Renown 3 or higher and 5th level of higher*

                        If you meet the prequiresites, you can apply to join the elite group known as the Hunting Corps. This special order serves as a combination of military police and military intelligence, giving it a fair degree of independence within the faction. Its members scout the activities of other factions to assess their military strength, predict potential threats, capture and interrogate individuals and they sometimes activate squads to defuse threats before they grow more serious. The Jägers also help the Wandenreich root out spies and leaks within the faction. Secondarily, the Jäger is responsible for policing the ranks of the army. When members get carried away by their zeal and break the law or abuse their authority, the Jäger take on the tasks of investigating, apprehending, and punishing the malefactors. Similarly, if members of the army disappear (involuntarily or otherwise), Jäger agents are typically the ones called to investigate.

                        #### Rank 3: Brigadier

                        *Prerequisite: Rank 2 and Renown 5 or higher*

                        As a brigadier, you are responsible for missions and strategies that you can’t execute entirely on your own or with the aid of a handful of soldat. After receiving goals handed down from the captain above you, it’s your job to figure out the tactics needed to accomplish those goals.

                        You lead a brigade that consists of six squads, each made up of four soldat commanded by a Feldwebel (use the soldier stat block). You can assign these squads to tasks of your choosing within the area you have authority. You can also lead these soldat into battle yourself, or bring one squad and its sergeant with you on a sanctioned mission.

                        You continue to receive a salary sufficient to maintain a modest lifestyle, but your quarters in the garrison are more spacious.

                        #### Silbern Guard (Special Role)

                        *Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher and 7th level or higher*

                        Members of the Silbern Guard are responsible for the defense of Silbern, the Wandenreich headquarters. Only those who have proven themselves in combat are selected to join this force. If you are accepted into the Silbern Guard, your missions will be primarily defensive in nature. You might receive orders to find new ways to fortify the fortress or to detect moles and other spies who try to gain access. Of course, given these chaotic times, you could end up defending Silbern from an all-out attack by some other enemy force.

                        #### Rank 4: Oberst (Colonel)

                        *Prerequisite: Rank 3 and Renown 10 or higher*

                        As a Oberst in the Wandenreich, you gain command of a small garrison and the responsibility for maintaining order and protecting people in part of a city district. You have four brigades under your command. As described for rank 3, each brigade has six squads of five soldat (including a Feldwebel) reporting to them. One additional squad of 2d4 soldat is your personal retinue.

                        You regularly receive communications from the Sternritter who coordinate the efforts of the smaller garrisons. They keep you informed of the goals and concerns of the Emperor and can help you address them. You are then responsible for giving orders to your brigadiers, and you must answer to your Sternritter for the troops’ success or failure in achieving the army's strategic goals.

                        As a Oberst, your salary allows you to maintain a comfortable lifestyle between adventures.

                        #### Sternritter (Special Role)

                        *Prerequisite: Rank 3, Renown 15 or higher and 10th level or higher*

                        As a Sternritter you're the emporer's elite guards. In this role, you are advised - and ordered around - by the Sternritter Grandmaster. You are in regular communication with the Emperor, who places you in charge of a major faction initiative. You might be tasked with improving recruitment, developing a plan for dealing with another faction, or collaborating with one, as well as leading an invasion.

                        At this rank, you gain a Sternritter Medallion (described in chapter X) at the start of each mission you undertake on the faction’s behalf. You draw a salary sufficient to maintain a wealthy lifestyle.

                        #### Thronfolger (Heir to the Throne) [Special Role]

                        *Prerequisite: Rank 4, Renown 25 or higher and 15th level or higher*

                        This position can only be bestowed by the Emperor. Your power, skillset, or mind has been acknowledged by the Emperor and they decided on you as their successor in the event of their death, or when they step down. 

                        At this rank you are under the wing of the Emperor as they familiarize you with their duties, from managing the Sternritter, to running the country.

                        # Xcution

                        Xcution is a secret society initially assembled under the founder and former Substitute Shinigami Kūgo Ginjō. This faction is a haven for those persecuted or wronged in one way or another due to their Fullbring powers and to master their abilities.

                        ### History

                        Kūgo initially formed the group to rob Ichigo Kurosaki of his latent Shinigami powers and share it amongst the group. Once his plan utterly failed most of the group was slain by the Shinigami. The surviving members disbanding and scattering.

                        After some time the members regrouped and decided to reform Xcution and keep its initial mission. For funding they also perform mercenary work. They quickly grew in power and became a much more structured faction mirroring the Gotei 13. 

                        Through the years Xcution and the Gotei 13 would sometimes work together, but their relationship, due to their history together, has been tenuous at best. More often they would clash, as Xcution has made the existence of Hollow's, Shinigami and other factions more known. Xcution believes that the more people know of Hollows, the easier it would be to monitor and protect the Human Realm. The Gotei 13 would see the dismantling of the Xcution, but the additional help they provide with protecting the Human Realm as well as the other realms, they more often turn a blind eye. This however, doesn't reassure Xcution and ensure they not only have the numbers to combat them if necessary, but technology to match them.

                        ### Structure

                        The entire faction is led by a council of 5 Magistrates, known as the Senatorum. All Magistrates were previously a Primaris who were elected as a Magistrate by the Senatorum.

                        Unlike the Gotei 13, the diferrent sectorums of Xcution work tightly and coherently together. They freely share information, contacts and other assets for the benefit of each other and the faction.

                        ### Sectorum Munitorum

                        This sectorum is one of the largest of the faction. They handle the administrative and bureaucratic duties of the faction. Additionally, they also perform many other important maintenance duties for the factions facilities and assets. 

                        The Sectorum also trains and licenses scribes, notaries, interpreters, cartographers, barristers, heralds, bookbinders to it's clients.

                        ### Sectorum Custodia

                        This sectorum brokers the services of bodyguards, mercenaries, and bounty hunters. They specialize in risk assessment and management, protecting clients from physical threats.

                        The Sectorum also patrols the Human realm warding off Hollow and being the eyes and ears for the faction.

                        ### Sectorum Obscura

                        This sectorum provides covert operation services, as well as assisting clients in protection against such operations. The sectorum licenses spies, assassins, locksmiths, security specialists, and more.

                        They also compile many dossiers on individuals, groups, or other factions to blackmail or as a deterrent to maintain Xcutions secrecy, safety and power.

                        ### Sectorum Cerebra

                        This sectorum focuses on science and research on reishi, hollow, other races as well as the mechanics and potential of fullbringers. They also research, craft and sell Kidō infused items.

                        Additionally, this is the sectorum new recruits go to to train, develop, and discover their Fullbring powers.

                        For income, this sectorum also consists of many artisans which provides a variety of goods and services to clients.

                        ### Sectorum Vitamora

                        This sectorum manages various establishments that provide healing and medicinal goods and services, both mundane and magical. Additionally they're also mystics that can help clients commune with the recent dead as well as perform Konsō rituals. These mystics also find spirits and assist them in passing over.

                        #### Rank 1: Xcution Affiliate

The sectorum also provides you with supplies you need to complete those missions (within reason). Additionally, you no longer need to pay membership fees.

                        Between adventures, you earn a salary that supports you at a modest lifestyle.

                        #### Rank 3: Sectorum Legatus
                        *Prerequisites: Renown 5 or higher in this division*

                        As a Legatus you are eligible to oversee your own projects, directing the efforts of other inceptors toward the solution of some problem facing the sectorum or faction. The Primaris gives you a personal work place if needed and you have a staff of 2d6 sectorum members.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        You can have this staff work on projects, run errands or perform other tasks related to your sectorum.

                        As a Primaris you are placed in charge on a Sectorum.

                    <div class="page">
                        # El Reino Hueco

                        Spanish for The Kingdom of Hollows. This Kingdom was initially united and formed by Baraggan Louisenbairn. Through his might he was able to unite every arrancar in Hueco Mundo under his rule, and for those that would not bow to him, would be destroyed. After some time he became the undisputed King of Hueco Mundo and the original ruler of Las Noches. However, after some time he became bored as a result of nothing to do, nothing to conquer, and no one to defeat, thus rendering his army nearly useless: its only purpose had become awaiting the invasion of another force.

                        After Aizen's defection, he made his way to Hueco Mundo and sought out Baraggan and quickly usurped him as King. Aizen kept Baraggan alive under the condition he served him. After Aizen's defeat and baraggan's passing, Tier Harribel, previously the third Espada, took over as the new King of Hueco Mundo and ensured the continued unification of all the arrancar.

                        ### Structure

                        Unlike the Gotei 13, the Espada, and the rest of the forces of Hueco Mundo are a collective of individuals and groups only organized together by the might of the current ruler of Hueco Mundo. Each Esapada member has their own quarters within Las Noches. They're also left to their own devices to do as they want as long as it doesn't disrupt the king's plans or cost harm any other Espada or Números.

                        #### Números
                        Spanish for numbers. The moment a hollow is "reborn" into an arrancar, they are conscripted into the King of Hueco Mundos army. Each one is assigned a two-digit number, starting with 11. This number indicates not the order of the Números' strength, but of their birth. Thus, the higher an Arrancar's number, the younger they are.

                        #### The Exequias

                        Spanish for Funeral Rites. This group cleans up after each battle, performs reconnaissance and data collection, and terminates any rebels or intruders in Las Noches, hence their name. 

                        This group was founded and lead by Rudbornn Chelute, the 61st arrancar. For most of it's existence, he was also it's only member, as all of his subordinates were created by his abilities.

                        #### Fracción

                        Spanish for fraction, are Arrancar that serve a specific Espada. As proof of their status, the Espada have the right to select subordinates from among the Números to supervise directly. They can choose one or many Fracción, or even none at all.

                        #### Espada

                        Spanish for sword, the original Espada was formed by Baraggan Louisenbairn, the previous King of Hueco Mundo.

                        This elite fighting force assisted him in leading his armies and conquered all of Hueco Mundo and established Las Noches as his palace.

                        The Espada are the ten top-ranked and most powerful Arrancar in Heuco Mundo controlled by the King of Hueco Mundo. Members of the Espada are given a number from 0-9. The lower the number, the more powerful the Espada. Each Espada has a tattoo with their number somewhere on them.

                        Only Vasto Lorde's can become an Espada, they're either added to the ranks by the current ruler, or they can challenge a current Espada to take their spot. If an Espada would be demoted they become a Privaron Espada and their number increases by 100.

                        Their immense power and leadership status among the Arrancar also grants each Espada the authority to exert command over the King's other forces within Las Noches: the Números, the Exequias, and their own Fracción, chosen by them from the Números.

                        #### Rank 1: Número
                        *Prerequisite: Renown 1 or higher*

                        As a Número you perform menial tasks by whichever higher ranking arrancar demands of you. You have a room within the large barracks in Las Noches.

                        #### Rank 2: Exequias 
                        *Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher*

                        You have proven yourself as a useful Número and have been promoted to the Exequias. No longer performing menial tasks, and fulfilling the tasks of the Exequias you are given greater responsibility, but you are still subordinate to any higher ranking member.

                        #### Rank 3: Fracción 
                        *Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher*

                        You have further proven yourself and have been recruited by an Espada to be a part of their Fracción. Your duties now consist of whatever your Espada assigns you too.

                        #### Rank 4: Espada 
                        *Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher*

                        You have become an Espada, from either defeating an Espada member to take their place, or from a vacancy opening up and being promoted by the King. As an Espada there is no greater authority than the King of Hueco Mundo. You are free to do as you'd like, so long as you follow any laws & rules of your King and you obey and protect the King as well.

                        You're also allowed to recruit from the Números to create your own Fracción. You're Fracción maximum size is 1 + your Charisma modifier and your Fracción total combined CR is equal to your level/HD + 1 and no Fracción member can be of equal level, HD or CR as you.

                        #### Rank 4: King of Hueco Mundo 
                        *Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher*

                        As the King of Hueco Mundo you are free to rule as you see fit. You control all Espada and Las Noches.

                        # Chapter 3: The Planes of Bleach
                        Within this chapter you'll find information on the various planes (or realms) of Bleach. Each one unique with it's own rules, denizens and dangers.

                        ### The Garganta
                        Spanish for "Throat", it is the space between realms. It is a featureless black void of turbulent and unstable Reishi. To move through it, travelers must create footholds using the Reishi or fall into the void and be lost forever.

                        #### The Valley of Screams
                        Valleys of Screams are pockets of space, varying in size, that reside within the Garganta. These demiplanes form from souls ejected from the reincarnation cycle and coalesce into a small realm. How and why these form is currently unknown.

                        ### The Living Realm
                        Otherwise known as the Human realm, it is the material plane of that as we knew it, Earth during the 2000's.

                        ### Dangai
                        Also known as the Precipice World, is a corridor-like demiplane in the Garganta that connects Soul Society and the Human Realm. Origninally, the Dangai was not only a passage to the Human realm, but a penal colony. This realm is an isolated space which is surrounded by numerous stacked-up layers of time's current, making it a temporally dense realm when compared to others. It is approximately 2,000 times denser, meaning that when one hour passes in the outside worlds, about 2,000 hours pass inside the Dangai.

                        The Kōryū and Kōtotsu are remnants of it's time as a penal colony and also act as a defensive mechanism against unwanted intruders. While the Dangai can be used to journey to and from Soul Society, those who have a Jigokuchō bypass this realm entirely.

                        The Kōryū (Wresting Flow) is the current that is constantly flowing through the Dangai, in order to prevent enemies from using it. This current takes the form of a thick sludge. The current stops those from moving, even if one foot is caught in it, escape is almost impossible. The current encompasses the floor, walls and ceiling.

                        The Kōtotsu (Wresting-surge) is the Dangai's equivalent to a street sweeper. It is made of the same material as the Dangai and appears similar to a bullet train with a bright golden eye at the upper-center of its body. The Kōtotsu appears every seven days to cleanse the area - killing anyone and everything it makes contact with it. This assures that no one lingers in the realm and takes advantage of the time distortion.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        ### Soul Society
                        Also known as the Spirit Realm, this plane is an afterlife where most souls go to and dwell until they're reincarnated into the Human Realm. While the denizens refer to it as Soul Society, this area is actually the East Branch of a larger Soul Society. The mode of life in Soul Society closely resembles that of feudal Japan.

                        When people die, they are assigned a number to a part of Soul Society according to when they died. Denizens never hunger here (unless they have spiritual powers) and lifespans of 2000 or more years are not unheard of. While some would describe this as a paradise, it is far from sublime. Life here is much like that of the living world. Children can be born the same way as in the Human Realm. People can also be killed as regular Humans, though they are capable of surviving wounds that would normally be considered fatal. A soul that dies in Soul Society is reincarnated on Earth as a new Human with no past memories.

                        Shinigami enter and leave Soul Society by unlocking the Senkaimon and using a Jigokuchō. Pluses can also enter Soul Society through Konsō. Intruders can pass through the Senkaimon in the same manner, but only in soul form. This allows spiritual beings, such as Ichigo in his Shinigami form, to enter without permission. Humans can also use such a gate through the use of Reishihenkanki (Spirit Exchangers), which convert solid matter into Reishi. Finally, Hollows can also directly rip a hole to Soul Society from Hueco Mundo, or in the case of Arrancar, using Garganta.

                        One of the more unusual aspects of Soul Society is its technology level. While the lifestyle and culture of Soul Society is comparable to feudal Japan, they possess technology of a level exceeding that time period. The Shinigami Research Institute has developed amazing technology to their credit, mixing technology with organic components. Allowing for the creation of creatures that do everything from detecting spiritual energy signatures to allowing Humans to see a spirit without the use of a Gigai. They possess touch-screens and databases which are in use for files and historical documentation storage found extensively in the Daireishokairo (Great Spirit Book Archive), which contains all the knowledge and history of Soul Society. View screen technology that is capable of sending signals to the Human World and Dangai, allowing for face to face conferencing. All manner of portable hand-held devices for tracking and communication purposes. Blending old traditions and ideas with new innovation, Soul Society is an enigma in this comparison.

                        #### Government
                        Soul Society is maintained by the Soul King whose existence is pivotal to the balance of the world as it regulates the flow of souls into and out of Soul Society, leaving administration to the Central 46 Chambers and Nobles. The Soul King lives at the Royal Palace in a demiplane separated from Soul Society itself and protected by the Royal Guard. The demiplane can only be accesssed with an Ōken (King's Key) The supposed location of this Ōken is passed down verbally from one Gotei 13 Captain-Commander to the next.

                        Another part of the government are the Noble Houses, especially the Four Noble Families which are considered to be the highest of them all.

                        The lower noble houses all serve one of the four. The military have no authority to act against a noble family without evidence that their actions are treasonous.

                        The Central 46 is an organization that serves as the judiciary authority of the Soul Society. Operating under a mandate from the Soul King, the influence of the Central 46 goes well beyond the boundaries of a judiciary authority and into those of legislative and operative authorities. The Central 46 is comprised of forty wise men, gathered from all over the Soul Society, and six judges. These men are in charge of trying all Shinigami crimes, whether they were committed in Soul Society or not. The Central 46 are also within their jurisdiction to order the use of deadly force by the military.

                        #### Seireitei
                        The Court of Pure Souls, is in the center of Soul Society. Seireitei is a circular shiro with four main entrances, ten days walk apart, each guarded by one of the Gatekeepers, elite members of incredible size. These gates are collectively called the Four Great Pure Soul Gates: these gates are made up of the Northern Black Ridge Gate, the Eastern Blue Stream Gate, the Southern Red Hollow Gate, and the Western White Road Gate. The gates are so heavy that it takes the full might of a gatekeeper to lift one. There are, however, doors within the gates, to allow passage of individuals when needed.

                        The walls of the Seireitei, known as the Seireiheki (Pure Soul Wall), are made of Sekkiseki (Spirit Reducing Stone), a rare type of stone known to negate all Reiryoku. The stone also forms a spherical barrier around the city, extending above and below, stopping anything spiritual from breaching it from ground level, from the sky or from underground. The wall that surrounds the Seireitei is commonly held up, only closing down when there is an emergency. When it is not down protecting the Seireitei, the wall protects the Soul King Palace.

                        The majority of the residents of Seireitei, nobility and Shinigami alike, do not interact with the citizens of Rukongai. The Central 46 chambers, the Shini'o Academy and all Gotei 13 divisions are located within the Seireitei.

                        #### Rukongai
                        Drifing Spirit town, is the largest portion of Soul Society and the most populated. It is divided into 320 districts (80 in North Rukongai, 80 in West Rukongai, etc.), each numbered in descending order on how far they are from the center; this results in the higher-numbered (and farther) districts decaying into slums. Thus, while District 1 is peaceful and lawful, much like the antiseptic lifestyle of early-Edo Era Kyoto, District 80 is a hardscrabble, violent, crime-infested area that more depicts Heian era Kyoto. The duties of the Gotei 13 Divisions include defending allocated districts of Rukongai.

                        The living standards in Rukongai decline sharply beyond the fiftieth district, with an increase in people wearing rags and no footwear. According to statistics from the last 550 years, no Rukongai resident wears sandals beyond District 59. Rukongai is full of families that are not related by blood. People die at different times and places, and it is rare for a person to find their real family in the vast Rukongai.

                        ### Schatten Bereich
                        German for Shadow Realm, after losing the war with the Shinigami 1,000 years ago, the Quincy escaped from the Human World into the Seireitei, the place they believed to be the most unguarded. In doing so, they used Reishi to create a demiplane in the "shadows". Their plan was to use the abundant Reishi that was only to be found in Soul Society as the source of their power, so they hid and waited for 1,000 years while gathering their power. This is what was called the Wandenreich, the "Invisible Empire".

                        Over 1,000 years ago, Yhwach had formed a Kingdom of Quincy named the Lichtreich (Empire of Light) which extended to all the nearby countries. In the 200 years since Yhwach's birth, the Lichtreich had conquered the nearby villages and lands.

                        #### Headquarters
                        The Wandenreich is currently based out of a building known as Silbern (Silver), known as the Silver Cross Castle, a large, ice-covered structure surrounded by a vast city roughly the size of the Seireitei. The Wandenreich uses metal plates, known as Gates of the Sun, to move around the large palace quickly. The headquarters is made purely out of Reishi particles from the Seireitei.

                        Silbern itself is a wide, two-tiered building. The bottom tier is supported by six thick columns, while the upper tier is roughly half as wide and long, instead being held up by pillars; it also features windows consisting of two thin slats in the wall on either side. The ground below it has a set of stairs leading up to the lower tier, and the entire complex is surrounded by an angular barrier with octagonal joints. Silbern is framed by two gutted, curving, tusk-like structures arching toward each other in front of it, and is dwarfed by a large, rectangular tower with a cross on each side rising up behind it.

                        #### Government
                        The Wandenreich is ruled by their emperor, previously Ywach, and is assisted by their advisor. The emperor chooses a crowned prince to replace them should they pass away or step down. The emperor has an elite group of quincy called the Sternritter (Star Knights), each as powerful, if not more powerful than a Captain from the Gotei 13 and led by the Sternritter Grandmaster. Several of these Sternritter that have proven to be the best serve as the emperors personal guard known as the Schutzstaffel. Then there is the Jagdarmee (Hunting Army) a hunting unit which, in the wake of Hueco Mundo's conquest by the Wandenreich, is entrusted with capturing Arrancar to serve the empire. Finally, there is the bulk of the army, the Soldat (Soldier) which can defeat low-ranked Shinigami with ease.

                        #### Military Attire
                        The typical attire of most Wandenreich personnel consists of a long, white, double-breasted trench coat with shoulder straps and a white, button-down bib. This coat is bound at the waist with a black belt, which is further adorned with a decorative buckle, and is worn over both white trousers and trench boots.

                        Many members sport white hats with black peaks and a crest emblazoned on its front, which is reminiscent of the five-pointed variant of the Quincy cross. This insignia is reflected by the buttons of their other apparel. Some higher-ranking members pair this uniform with other additional pieces of clothing, such as capes or cloaks, to distinguish themselves.[43] The Sternritter wear a distinctive white, ankle-length cloak over their uniform which features the Wandenreich insignia emblazoned on its back and often a hood attached to the cloak's collar. Apart from the standard uniform, a Soldat's attire consists of a military beret, black goggles with white lenses, a gas mask which obscures their entire face, and a short, collared cloak.

                        ### The Royal Palace
                        The Royal Palace is a demiplane kept suspended above Soul Society that serves as the official residence of the Soul King and its Royal Guard. The Soul King Palace consists of several layers, with one layer suspended above the other. The lowest level is comprised from many buildings of the same style to that of Seireitei. From this, a large stairway leads upwards to a wide and flat expanse, with both areas at the base and top of these stairs being lined by rows of huge, circular pillars. This area is known as the Royal Palace Approach. Floating above are five discs, Known as the zero estates, with a town on each disc, each one ruled over by one of the Royal Guard members. Suspended higher still is a large cylindrical structure that has a conical top and bottom, this is the Royal Palace proper.

                        #### Entry
                        The route to the inner dimension in which the palace resides can only be opened with "a key", fittingly named the Ōken (Royal Key), the location of which is kept secret, only being passed down verbally from one Gotei 13 Captain-Commander to the next. There are only two ways to enter the Spirit King Palace:
                        1. With the permission of the Royal Guard. They don't have to be there physically, they only need to want the person to enter.
                        2. Using an Ōken.

                        A Royal Guard can also open up a Chōkaimon (Super World Gate) to send someone directly to the Human World, and use the same gate to send said "someone" back, but to do so requires syncing the arrival and departure times. when the Royal Guard do need to travel, their preferred method of transportation takes the form of a huge pillar called the Tenchūren (Heavenly-Pillar Palanquin). While this pillar is able to freely exit the demiplane, it is unable to return to the palace on its own and is instead entirely reliant on outside assistance to do so, such as Kūkaku Shiba's Kakaku Hō (Flower Crane Cannon).

                        #### Defenses
                        The sekkiseki walls that surround Seireitei are ordinarily intended to protect the Soul King Palace, instead meant only to fall down to Seireitei in times of emergency. However, if emergencies occur in succession, they remain in place around Seireitei indefinitely until things are returned to normal.

                        The Soul King Palace is further protected by 72 barriers between it and the Seireitei. Should these barriers be forced open via clothing constructed from an Ōken, they cannot be closed off for 1 hour and 40 minutes due to the sheer defensive power of the clothing.

                        There exist a group of elite guards known as "Divine Soldiers" which are led by Senjumaru Shutara, who refers to them as the "Blade of the Soul King". Each guard wears a black hakama with a purple sash tied around their waist and a black mask with four light-colored lines tracing over their heads, and their hair is tied into a long spike at the back of their head before being left to hang free about halfway through the length. They are all armed with swords.

                        There is a much more powerful version of these soldiers known as a "Second-Class Divine Soldier", which Senjumaru refers to as the "Shield of the Soul King". They resemble an ordinary soldier, but are extremely large and wear a circular black hat on their head. The backs of their wrists each have one-half of a large, black, circular shield on them.

                        #### The Royal City
                        The main Royal city is ran by the Royal Family. This sprawling city about the same size of Seireitei is shrouded in mystery. Only thing known of its denizens is that when a captain is promoted to the Royal Guard, they are allowed to bring their family with them as well.

                        #### The Zero Estates
                        Each Royal Guard member is awarded a town for them to oversee. The Royal Guard are free to shape and govern these towns however they wish. Some model it like any other town, others shape it for a single function and few make it so it's not uninhabited and use it for their own machinations.

                        ### Hell
                        Is an afterlife where Souls are sent if they were wicked when they were Human. For example, the Zanpakutō of a Shinigami can only cleanse Souls of the sins they committed as Hollows. If the spirit committed heinous crimes as a Human, it will be sent through the Gates of Hell instead of Soul Society.

                        The Gates of Hell are chained shut and adorned with the bandaged head and torso of a skeleton on each door. The arms of both skeletons are positioned at an angle to pull the gates open when it is summoned. On the inside, the Gates appear to be prevented from opening fully by two thick ropes with charms attached to them. The face and left arm of a large demonic creature can be seen behind the Gates. It has armor plating on its upper arm and it wields a blade. Its left arm and face are covered in tattoos resembling tribal markings. The demon skewers the souls entering Hell with its blade, and pulls it through the Gates, while laughing. The Gates then close and the entire structure cracks and crumbles into nothing.

                        Aside from being an afterlife for sinners, Hell's other primary function is to hold deceased captains of the Gotei 13, due to the Reishi comprising their bodies being too dense with Reiatsu to be reabsorbed by Soul Society and such powerful Reishi being too risky to allow to remain intact in the realm; this is accomplished by the performance of Konsō Reisai twelve years after a captain's death, though until the usage of this ceremony for Jūshirō Ukitake, the captains and lieutenants of the Gotei 13 had no idea it would result in their former comrades being cast into Hell. 

                        Similar to the balance of Souls between the Human World and Soul Society, Hell's integrity is maintained by a balance of Reiatsu between it and the combined realms of the Human World and Soul Society. When that balance is disrupted those within Hell can wrench open the gates and enter the Human World. During such an imbalance, performance of the Konsō Reisai is accompanied by the appearance of Jigoku no Rinki (Hellish Phosphoplasm), black blobs of a non-Reishi substance that float through the air of Soul Society around the grave of the deceased captain that the ceremony is being performed for as well as in the air of the Human World where a denizen of Hell has entered the realm; this substance is harmless when touched normally, but if a globule is cut in two by a Zanpakutō, its contents become acidic. Individuals who enter the Human World from Hell by taking advantage of this imbalance do so using a portal resembling a circular Garganta lined with teeth, though they can also be pulled back into Hell through the usual Gates.

                        #### Government
                        Hell has no known government or rulers, and is stated to fall outside of the jurisdiction of the Gotei 13..

                        #### Denizens
                        Those who have been cast down to Hell are transformed into Togabito (Sinners), they gain a white garb with thin black stripes and are bound by indestructible chains. Whilst in Hell, the Togabito are tormented in a constant cycle of rebirth, death and regeneration. Their tormentors being the Kushanāda.

                        The Kushanāda are the only known natural inhabitants of Hell, these gargantuan beings guard and punish the imprisoned Togabito for their crimes they committed while they were alive. They have elongated skull-like heads and a large piece of armor on their right shoulders. If they catch a Togabito, they will eat it, only for it to revive itself sometime later.

                        Hell uniquely affects any Arrancar cast into it after their death by moving their Hollow hole outside of their body and allowing them to gain new powers

                        Jigoku no Gaki (Beasts of Hell) are massive Hollows uniquely originating from Hell. While their appearances vary wildly, common visual motifs between them include large rings protruding from or comprising parts of their bodies and thick chain patterns on their skin. In addition to possessing great strength befitting their size, they do not emit any Reiatsu, allowing them to sneak up on even spiritually-aware Shinigami.

                        ### Hueco Mundo
                        Spanish for Hollow World, is the plane in which Hollows and Arrancar usually reside. It lies in between the Human World and Soul Society. Though it is separated from the bordering dimension known as the Dangai. It can be accessed by traversing the Garganta, a void between the worlds which can be crossed by Hollows, allowing them to travel to any other dimension at will.

                        An unchanging night covers the sky, an endless white desert covers the ground. The tree-like objects are not plants, but rather quartz-like minerals. The landscape of Hueco Mundo is a seemingly never-ending white desert, with a multitude of dunes, littered with boulders. In Hueco Mundo, the moon is on the opposite lunar phase of that in the Human World. The vast desert seems to lack any bodies of water and contains rocky formations. Like in Soul Society, the atmosphere is filled with a high concentration of Reishi, thus allowing smaller Hollows to gain nourishment despite the lack of Human souls.

                        Similar to the case of Human World deserts, active life in Hueco Mundo appears to be few and far between. Hollows generally dwell below the surface or in other areas until something provokes them to leave their shelter, like the intrusion of a foreign entity. All Hollows dwell in Hueco Mundo regardless of their shape, size, or power. When a hollow would be destroyed, and it wasn't slain by a Zanpakutō, or annihilated by Quincy's Heilig Bogen, they will reform in Hueco Mundo some time later.

                        #### Government
                        Hueco Mundo has an informal government, the strongest being wields power and is known as the King of Hueco Mundo. They reside within the palace known as Las Noches and controls the Espada and other "military" branches.

                        #### Las Noches
                        Spanish for "The Nights", is a massive fortress which can be seen for miles. It consists of a main building with a domed center surrounded by several large towers and smaller buildings. Atop the dome are five smaller towers, which appear to contain areas such as the King's throne room and the Espada meeting hall.

                        The Espada reside there with their army of Arrancar complete with medical facilities and detention wings. Las Noches is an exceedingly large structure, as large as the Seireitei in Soul Society, taking about three days to move from one area to a gate.

                        The inside of Las Noches' dome simulates the blue sky of the Human World. The position of the halls within the palace can also be adjusted, allowing the one operating them to direct the movements of intruders.

                        #### The Forest of Menos
                        is an area below the surface of Hueco Mundo's desert where the average Hollow hide from the Arrancar. The forest is filled with large trees made of a silvery quartz substance. These trees extend to the surface and dot the landscape of the desert in Hueco Mundo. Countless Gillian class Hollow live here and follow the commands of the Guardian of the Forest of Menos and his followers. The Adjuchas in charge of the Forest of Menos are under the command of the King.

                        #### Negal Ruins
                        These ancient ruins are all that remains of what Hueco Mundo used to be, before it became an endless desert. Not much is known and minimal efforts have been made to uncover more of the ruins and study them.

                        #### Laws
                        When operating underneath Sōsuke Aizen, certain laws were in place that were meant to be followed, the following laws were continued by the current King of Hueco Mundo:

                        * It is an offense to invade the World of the Living without permission.
                        * It is an offense for Espada members to mobilize their Fracción without authorization.
                        * It is an offense for Espada members to utilize the Exequias without authorization.
                        * It is forbidden for Espada ranked four and above from releasing their Zanpakutō within Las Noches.
                        * It is forbidden for any Espada to use a Gran Rey Cero inside Las Noches.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        ### The Beast Realm
                        An afterlife of boundless wilderness, nature and fauna. When Humans or hollows commit heinous crimes, they're sent to Hell. However, when a Soul from Soul Society, or Schatten Bereich commit heinous crimes, they're reincarnated as a beast in the Beast Realm.

                        Those who have died and are reincarnated in the beast realm are referred to as Petitioners. When a petitioner is brought to the Beastlands, they take on the form of a beast that represents their crimes and live out as the animal as punishment. For example, if a murderer who preyed upon others would be sent here, they would take on the form of a mouse or rabbit, to be hunted upon. The petitioners have vague memories of their life before the Beastlands, mostly emotions around certain people, objects or creatures.

                        The Beast realm has a layer for every biome. Each layer has weather that is regionally distributed and provides all manner of conditions for the habitats of all creatures. Weather in one region doesn't affect adjacent regions, so an arid desert could exist next to a snowy winter region for example. These layers also interact and intersect other layers in various places as well.

                        #### Travel
                        Until recently, travel to the Beast realm was unknown and thought impossible. There were only two known methods, each closely guarded secrets. The first was a cave in the Soul Society guarded by the Werewolf clan, with the location only known by the Sajin clan. The second was a ritualistic hunt, where one would embark into the wilderness and attempt to hunt a powerful beast. At the end of the hunt when one would take the kill and prove successful, they'd find themselves in the beast realm. This ritual was guarded by the Shihōin clan.

                        However, after the imbalance from Hell, travel to the Beast realm through the Garganta was made possible. Currently the Gotei 13's 12th division is rigorously studying the Beast realm and on how it plays in part with the balance of souls.

                        Traveling across the plane is relatively straightforward and just requires you to walk to your destination. Walking between the layers of the Beast realm can happen erratically and when you least expect it. Ducking beneath a branch, you might find the tranquil forest replaced with the scorching heat of a desert. On the other hand, you might be being chased between two trees when all of a sudden you're catching yourself from falling off a cliff. These portals are common and it is quite easy to accidentally stumble upon them and make your way back to another layer.

                        #### Traits
                        This plane creates a hunger to eat, a yearning to hunt and to become more bestial in nature. This hunger is not a painful hunger, but rather a singular focus to fulfill the needs of hunting and to take part in eating a meal you hunted for. Though, visitors should be very careful because the beasts you hunt in the Beast realm may appear to be like the typical beasts in the Material Plane, but these beasts are cunning and intelligent. They can speak and form plans among other members of their packs, and they often end up becoming the hunter instead of the hunted.

                        The longer you stay in the Beast realm, the more likely that you will begin to start taking on the characteristics of beasts. A mighty warrior might begin growing tufts of fur like that of a bear, or a perceptive mage might grow the crooked beak of a hawk. These characteristics can be slow to take hold, those who value law are the slowest for these characteristics to start appearing, but they always do. For those closest to the wilderness, they take only a few hours while those who come from more civilized backgrounds might take a few days. These animal characteristics are only temporary and will disappear after a few days outside of the Beast realm.

                        #### Denizens
                        Most denizens are the petitioners and native inhabitants, taking on various bestial forms, the beastfolk and the Beast Lords. The beast folk are those who have survived long enough and through one way or another regained their humanity. They take on an anthropomorphic version of the beast they are, one such individual is the previous Captain Sajin Komamura. The Beast Lords are powerful creatures that are as powerful if not more powerful than Captains. They hunt across the plane, protecting their lands and provide direction and power in the chaotic wilderness

                        #### Government
                        The beast realm has no official government with every beast needing to defend themselves. However, each Beast lord has it's own clan. These "clans" are only official in name, with the bestial nature, these clans more closely resemble packs or prides that one would see in the wilderness in the Human realm.

                        You hav, for whatever reason, been banished from your homeland. This could have been from your own choice, rejecting your society. Perhaps you committed a crime or were framed for a crime. Maybe you had dangerous heretical ideals. Regardless of the reason, you are no longer welcomed in the home you grew up in and would face serious consequences if you returned.

                        **Skill Proficiencies:** Survival, your choice of Animal Handling, Religion, Arcana or Sleight of Hand  

                        **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan tools, or forgery kit

                        **Equipment:** A memento of your past life, a set of artisan’s tools your proficient with or a forgery kit, a winter blanket, a set of common clothes, and a ouch containing 5gp.

                        #### Reason of Banishment
                        What was the reason for your banishment, and what changed to allow the end of your banishment? You can work with your DM to determine the exact nature of your banishment, or you can roll on the table below to determine the reason.

                        | d6  | Reason of Banishment |
                        |:---:|:-----------:|
                        |  1  | Deviant |
                        |  2  | Refugee |
                        |  3  | Heretic |
                        |  4  | Framed |
                        |  5  | Lawbreaker |
                        |  6  | Revolutionist |

                        #### Feature: All Eyes on You
                        Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, or  perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.

                        You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.

                        #### Suggested Characteristics
                        Some people are well suited for a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for home. Whether they embrace their banishment or long to escape it, the banishment shapes their attitude and ideals. Few grow resentment, fewer can be driven slightly mad by their years apart from their home, family and friends.

                        ## Artificial Souls
                        Translated from Gikon in Japanese, Artificial souls and the means to insert them into a body were created by Kirio Hikifune and her team of scientists. Before she came along, the thought of making artificial souls was a foreign one. She built upon the idea of Gikon and created the Gikongan (artificial pill). According to the core theory behind the artificial soul is to take the Reiatsu from one source and inject it into a different body, with the intention of turning the introduced power into that body's own. For this great achievement and contribution to Soul Society, Kirio was promoted to the Royal Guard.

                        Some time later more research was made into this technology. In an attempt to even the gap between Shinigami and Hollows, as Hollows generally outnumber Shinigami, project spearchead was initiated. This project seeked to create Modified Souls, more commonly referred to as Mod-Souls, are artificial souls designed to enhance regular Human physiology, making them capable of battling Hollows equally.

                        The Mod-Souls created varied in their abilities and can be defined by different types. For example, one Mod-Soul may be able to run many times faster than a regular Human while another may be many times stronger than normal. The Mod-Souls, just like regular artificial souls, are condensed into tiny, candy-like orbs. However, their originally intended purpose was to be placed into corpses to achieve their function as soldiers to combat Hollows. To fit with this purpose, they are also more independent than regular artificial souls.

                        The Mod-Souls were exterminated after the experiment was halted due to ethical reasons, since they were intended to be used to reanimate Human corpses to be used as weapons against Hollows. Most were exterminated, though few escaped, some were hidden, and few were mixed in with regular Gikongan.

                        Now the pills are mainly used by Shinigami when they're operating in the Human Realm when they have a gigai. By ingesting a Gikongan the pill forces the soul out of the body and allows the artificial soul to take control of it, operating in a pre-programmed manner until removed by the Shinigami. They can be used on a body which has no soul, such as a corpse, or even an inanimate object, such as a stuffed animal. These artificial souls possess their own personalities, which can be specially designed to fit one's specifications.

                        Currently, gikongan are commonly called Soul Candy, because the Shinigami Women's Association complained that its name was not cute and had it changed. To fit with the more informal name, Soul Candy is contained in toy dispensers, which have the heads of cartoon characters on them. These dispensers come in many varieties, with some being more popular than others. Artificial souls tend to have personalities which reflect traits of their corresponding dispenser's character.

                        ### Artificial Soul Traits
                        Your Artificial Soul character has the following traits.

                        **Soul Candy.** While not within a body, an artificial soul is a tiny pill with 10 Armor Class, 5 hit points, immune to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerable to bludgeoning damage.     
                        **Ability Score Increase.** As an artificial soul you were initially created to battle Hollows, as such your physical attributes were enhanced. Choose two different physical ability scores and one mental ability score, they each increase by 1.      
                        **Age.** Artificial souls have not been observed to have a maximum lifespan; they have not shown any signs of deterioration due to age.       
                        **Alignment.** Each Artificial Soul is designed with a specific alignment, though generally are lawful and/or neutral.        
                        **Size.** The artificial soul takes on the size of the body they inhabit, though it usually is Medium as that is the standard size of Gigai and Humans/Souls.        
                        **Speed.** While the artificial soul inhabits a body, its base walking speed becomes 40 feet.       
                        **Sentry's Rest.** When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.     
                        **Specialized Design.** You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.     
                        **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.     
                        **Spiritual Awareness.** Artificial Souls can see into and interact with the ethereal plane.        

                        \pagebreakNum

                        ## Humans
                        A living being who resides in the Human Realm. Most, if not all, beings who live in the Human World are Humans.

                        The majority of Humans are completely oblivious to the dangers they are exposed to from Hollow and other evil spirits. It is unknown how many Hollow attacks against Humans occur under normal circumstances, but Hollows make their former loved ones into their first victims before they begin preying on Pluses and Humans with spiritual powers. A severe enough attack from a Hollow, or a Shinigami, on a living Human would not only result in bodily harm, but in the removal of the Human's Soul from the body. The damage can be easily repaired through Kidō if the Chain of Fate is not broken.

                        Shinigami are forbidden by law from attacking Humans unless ordered to. They generally ignore Humans, but a part of their duties is protecting the Humans in jeopardy from Hollows. Some Shinigami have a tendency to view Humans as inferior, despite the majority of Souls, including most Shinigami, being of Human origins.

                        A very small percentage of the Human population develops a high amount of Spiritual Power; they are known as "High-Spec" Humans. These Humans can see and interact with Reishi-made objects, such as Souls, to varying degrees and for various reasons.

                        ### High-Spec Human
                        **Creature Type:** Humanoid     
                        **Size:** Medium (about 4-7 feet tall) or Small (about 2-4 feet tall), chosen when you select this race     
                        **Speed:** 30 feet      
                        **Life Span:** 90 years on average      
                        **Resourceful.** You gain Inspiration whenever you finish a long rest.      
                        **Skillful.** You gain Proficiency in one Skill of your choice.     
                        **Versatile.** You gain a Feat of your choice       
                        **Spiritual Awareness.** You can see into and interact with the ethereal plane.      

                        ### Human Lineages
                        The following are lineages you chan choose to be part of. You gain the lineages traits. A character might also gain a Lineage through a remarkable or tragic event. Work with your DM to establish if you’re amenable to such a development and how such stories unfold. Lineages marked with an asterisk (*) are suggested to not be chosen at character creation.

                        #### Soul
                        The spiritual beings that reside within Soul Society, and the spirits of dead Humans in the Human Realm are Souls. While many Souls are deceased Humans from the Human World, it is known that they can be born within Soul Society as well. There are a few different type of souls as described below.

                        Pluses are the benign souls in the Human World. They are the spirit of a person who has died. A chain, known as the Chain of Fate, protrudes from the chest and connects the soul to its living body. When this chain is severed, the soul can no longer return to its body and live.

                        The soul can move about freely if the chain is broken, but this also causes the chain to slowly corrode. Normally, pluses are sent to Soul Society by Shinigami in a ritual called Konsō before this corrosion becomes significant. If the Chain of Fate is corroded entirely, the Plus will become a Hollow.

                        Jibakurei (earch-bound spirit) are souls who are bound to a place and refuse to pass on. A Jibakurei is more vulnerable to a Hollow, as being bound to a certain area prevents them from fleeing as far as a normal Plus. This means that the Hollow would only need to search in a small area to find them. It can take months or even years for a Jibakurei to become a Hollow.

                        A Tsukirei (Possessive Spirit) is a soul very similar to a Jibakurei as it is also unable to leave the Human World because of something they regret leaving behind. The difference is that a Tsukirei is bound to a person, with the Chain of Fate being wrapped around said person.

                        A Blank is a soul with no memory that has become lost in the space between the Soul Society and the Human World, called the Valley of Screams.

                        A Soul would have the same statistics and traits as it did when it was alive.

                        **Augmented Spiritual Pressure.** You retain your creature type as Humanoid, yet you register as an Undead to spells and other effects that detect the presence of the Undead creature type.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Fullbringer
                        Fullbringers are spiritually-aware Humans born with the ability to manipulate the souls that reside in all physical matter. These powers originate from Hollow reiryoku. Like all spiritually aware Humans, Fullbringers can sense the Reiryoku of other spiritual beings, such as Hollows, Shinigami, and other Fullbringers. However, they differ in that they each have a parent who survived a Hollow attack before they were born. As a result, traces of the Hollows’ power remained in their parents bodies, which were then passed onto them at the moment of their birth. Therefore, their powers more closely resemble a Hollow’s than those of a Shinigami.

                        Their ability, called Fullbring, enables them to manipulate the souls contained within matter. Everything, even rudimentary objects such as lampposts and chairs possess a soul, however small. By using their power to “pull” on this soul, Fullbringers can manipulate the object's movement or even alter its physical characteristics. For example, Fullbringers could have a beverage assist them in drinking it by pulling on its soul, drawing it into their mouth. Likewise, by pulling on the soul of water, Fullbringers can walk across its surface without falling through. Many more feats are possible, making the technique highly versatile. Unlike other spiritual beings, Fullbringers use their power with their physical bodies. Because of this, they must train extensively to build up their stamina so they can use it properly. While all Fullbringers are born with this power, the age at which they come to realize it varies. When Fullbringers die, all traces of their abilities disappear from the world. However, they do carry their abilities into the afterlife.

                        **Ability Score Increase.** One ability score of your choice increases by 1.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Quincy
                        Japanese for Monk of Destruction, Quincy are spiritually aware Humans able to absorb and manipulate Spirit Particles into spiritual weapons. The Quincy were a clan scattered all over the world dedicated to fighting Hollows. It is currently unknown when the Quincy first came into being. Some state that Yhwach began the Quincy and his blood flows in every Quincy. However, according to the Quincy themselves, there were Quincy before Yhwach.

                        While they are trained to confront Hollows in order to defeat them just as Shinigami do, the biggest difference between the Quincy and Shinigami, since ancient times, is whether or not to kill Hollows. The Shinigami purify Hollows with their Zanpakutō and send them to Soul Society, while the Quincy killed the Hollows. The idea can be seen as comparing justice and vengeance: "Hollows devour souls of Humans, so why must it be that those who harm and kill friends and relatives get sent peacefully to Soul Society?" Captain Mayuri Kurotsuchi surmises Quincy are not hostile to Hollows because of a difference in ideology, because Hollow have no ideology, and theorizes there is only one reason for them to maintain such a grudge for so long: the Quincy fear the Hollows who endanger their lives. This view is corroborated by Kisuke Urahara, who reveals that Quincy have no "anti-bodies" to defend from Hollows; Hollows are poisonous to Quincy. If a Quincy is infected by a Hollow, not only does their Reiryoku weaken leading to death, but their soul itself is destroyed; they cannot even undergo Hollowfication like a Shinigami. This is why Quincy must eradicate Hollows.

                        Shinigami govern the souls between the Human World and Soul Society, which maintains a balance that if not kept would result in the mutual destruction of both worlds. All souls, including Hollows, are subject to the Shinigami governance of maintaining the balance. Quincy completely extinguish Hollows, thus the souls that come to the Human World do not return to Soul Society and therefore the souls would increase only on the side of the Human World. As a result, the Human World becomes heavy in souls, causing Soul Society to spill over into it, mixing life and death together.

                        With the potential destruction of both worlds, Soul Society tried to appeal to the Quincy that the handling of Hollows should be left to the Shinigami. The Quincy refused to accept the situation. As time went on, the number of Quincy increased and the cycle of souls became more unstable, forcing the Shinigami to reluctantly wipe out the Quincy in order to maintain the balance of the world. Few escaped into the Schatten Bereich and some into the other realms, primarily the Human realm.

                        The Quincy line was closely monitored over the decades, as their numbers continued to dwindle. Later the Quincy advanced the idea that since they were already among the living and still more numerous at the time, they could act as "first responders" to Hollow attacks: protecting Humans until the less-numerous Shinigami could send a representative to finish the Hollow off. Embittered by the recent war, the Shinigami refused to participate, opting instead to allocate their limited resources to reacting to the most dangerous Hollows and current Hollow attacks.

                        **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.      
                        **Hollow vulnerability.** Hollow attacks, abilities and spells deals an additional 2d6 damage to you.       
                        **Acute Reiatsu Perception.** You have advantage on reiatsu checks.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Visored*
                        The Visored are a group of Shinigami that have acquired Hollow powers through experimentation, usually not of their own free will. When a Hollow is inserted into the soul of a Shinigami it merges with them and their Zanpakutō. This process is very dangerous as the Shinigami must battle this Hollow within them. Losing this battle results in the Hollow taking of their body, however if the Shinigami wins they gain the ability to don a Hollow mask, and have access to Hollow powers. This process is known as Hollowfication.

                        The Visored appear entirely Human and, barring when they use their powers, are indistinguishable from ordinary Shinigami. To gain access to their Hollow powers, a Visored dons a Hollow mask. Their spiritual pressure likewise changes into a mix of  Hollow and Shinigami.

                        The transition from a Shinigami into a Visored is usually met with swift exile from Soul Society. The Visored and any other parties involved will be considered criminals by the Soul Society for breaking the law of acquiring Hollow powers. Their status or rank of any kind are stripped and if apprehended would spend the rest of their days in the deepest level of the Central Great Underground Prison.

                        ### Supernatural Gift: Visored

                        The Dungeon Master has the option to allow a character created in a Bleach campaign to be Visored. Alternatively, a character who undergoes Hollowfication in the course of a campaign might become a Visored.

                        Becoming a Visored is a supernatural gift (see "Supernatural Gifts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) that bestows upon you the following traits.

                        **Inner Battle.** To first gain access to the the rest of the traits you must first defeat the Hollow merging with your soul. 

                        You must spend 1 minute meditating to enter your Inner World. Once their you immediately battle the Hollow. You have access to all your armament and abilities as you normally would, but no other equipment. The Hollow takes on the appearance of you, but a dark, twisted and evil version. It uses the same statistics as your character but with the Hollow template applied.

                        While battling with your Hollow, your actual body starts to spill white material from its eyes and mouth and transforming into a Hollow and goes on a rampage attacking anyone in sight trying to devour any souls. For each soul your Hollow possessed body devours, it gains a cumulative +1 bonus on all ability checks, skill checks and damage rolls within the Inner Battle.

                        If you would lose the Inner Battle, you are slain, the Hollow takes over your body and transforms into an Arrancar and is controlled by the DM. If your actual body would be slain, you are slain as well.

                        However, if you would defeat the Hollow, you emerge victorious, donning your Hollow mask. You gain four Hollow abilities.

                        **Hollow Mask.** On your turn, as a bonus action you don your Hollow mask, gaining the following benefits.

                        * You gain access to your Hollow abilities.
                        * All forms of movement you have are increased by 20 feet.
                        * You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
                        * You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources.

                        Your mask lasts for 1 minute increments, for a total number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus. You may dismiss your mask at will and you regain all expended minutes on a long rest.

                        Whenever you would gain a level, you gain a Hollow ability (your level = your HD amount) or an armament ability. Starting at level 10, your HD is increased by your proficiency bonus for the purposes of fulfilling HD prerequisites for Hollow abilities.

                        **Augmented Spiritual Pressure.** You retain your creature type, yet you register as a Hollow to spells and other effects that detect the presence of the Hollow creature type.

                        ## Hollow
                        Are former Pluses who lose their hearts to despair or regret, or they remain in the Human World for too long. These corrupt spirits with supernatural powers devour the souls of both living and deceased Humans. Hollows settle in Hueco Mundo, but can traverse the Garganta into the Human World, Soul Society and other realms.

                        The majority of souls peacefully move on to the Soul Society after their death. However, some stay in the living world to fulfill certain goals, such as looking after a loved one, protecting a particular location, or pursuing a grudge from beyond the grave. However, with only limited abilities to interact with the living, and by definition tied to their goals, many souls find they are unable to cope when their loved ones move on or old enemies forget them. At this point, some will become dangerously obsessed with fulfilling those goals, even if the means to fulfill them renders the soul empty: for example, killing anyone who comes near a loved one in order to keep them from hurting that person. In doing so, the ghost warps into a Hollow and, ironically, often makes the focus of their obsession into their first victim.

                        The process by which a soul becomes a Hollow is reflected by the length of the soul's Chain of Fate, which usually resides in the center of their chest, and connects to their bodies, if present. The Chain of Fate slowly corrodes over time, coinciding with the degradation of the soul's ties to the living world. The process can be accelerated under certain conditions, such as being attacked by a Hollow, giving into extreme despair, or using certain spiritual powers. When the chain completely decays, they become a Hollow when a hole opens up on their chest where the chain was attached, signifying they have lost their heart.

                        Once a soul becomes a Hollow, it is driven by an eternal and insatiable hunger to devour other souls, living or dead, to fill the void caused by its descent. Hollows are usually mindless creatures concerned only with finding the most potent souls to devour. Stronger and more evil Hollows are often able to retain some of their intelligence in Hollow form, making them more dangerous than the average Hollow. 

                        All Hollows wear masks, which are formed from the hearts they had lost as Humans. This mask protects the naked instinct which is left in a being after the loss of its heart, and obscures the original identity of the Hollow. The masks of different Hollows can differ greatly in shape and form, but are always white and skull-like. The mask can be shattered, temporarily allowing the Hollow to regain its original identity, but it will regenerate after a short period once the Hollow takes over again. When a Hollow's heart is carved out by the hole in their chests, the lost heart becomes its mask. The powers a Hollow wields are manifestations of its heart.

                        When a Hollow is slain by a Shinigami's Zanpakutō, the Hollow is not truly killed; its spirit is purified of the sins it committed as a Hollow. This allows the spirit within to enter the Soul Society as a Plus. In cases where a Hollow committed great sins as a mortal, its purification will summon the gates of Hell, through which the soul is dragged to its punishment. When a Hollow is killed by a Quincy, it is destroyed, soul and all. When dispatched by other spiritual powers, the Hollow will reform back in Hueco Mundo some time later.

                        ### Menos Classification
                        Though most Hollows are simply transformed Human souls, a sub-group of Hollows known as Menos Grande, or simply Menos, exist. Menos are created when the void within an ordinary Hollow's heart becomes so substantial Human souls are incapable of sustaining it, at which point it begins devouring fellow Hollows. These cannibal Hollows are attracted to one another, and a mass inter-devouring follows, resulting in a Gillian. This is the first of the three categories of Menos, the three being: Gillian, Adjuchas and Vasto Lorde.

                        Menos evolution is not only contingent upon the Menos eating other Hollows, but also upon the Menos' ability to avoid being eaten. If another Hollow succeeds in devouring even a part of their body, evolution becomes impossible for the one who was wounded this way. Menos-class Hollows are considered so dangerous Soul Society sends only highly trained Shinigami teams to handle them.

                        #### Gillian
                        Are the first and weakest of all Menos. There are many of them, and they all look alike. In Soul Society, they are the "Menos" who are generally referred to in textbooks. Gillians are huge, but they are slow and have beast-like intellect that commonly attack in a group. 

                        Gillians are gargantuan Hollows at least 2-6 stories tall, easily dwarfing even the largest standard Hollow. They all have a white mask with an elongated nose. Their bodies are covered from their head to their feet with a black covering reminiscent of a cloak. Around their neck is a row of thin white spikes. They have large, pointed feet wrapped in white bandages. They have large white hands with long, sharp, white nails, but they are commonly hidden within their cloak, rarely revealed even in combat. They have long tongues capable of breaking a fellow Hollow's mask.

                        Though Gillians usually have no personality to speak of, which makes them dangerous since they have no mind of their own, one of the many Hollows which comprise it might gain control over the newly formed entity, reflected in the unique mask it wears in comparison to a normal Gillian. Only these Gillian variants have the potential to evolve into Adjuchas-class Menos. The evolution is facilitated by the continued cannibalization of fellow Hollows, even other Gillians.

                        #### Adjuchas
                        Are the second classification of Menos. They are smaller than Gillians as they get more powerful they're able to more precisely control their reiryoku. They are much smarter and stronger than Gillians, and are often the ones who lead Gillians into battle. Adjuchas are commonly solitary creatures, rarely joining into groups. Adjuchas can vary radically in appearance, anywhere from bulky humanoids to beast-like characteristics.

                        Adjuchas-class Menos are much smaller in population compared to the Gillian class, due to the rarity of any one Hollow being capable of overwhelming the many other Hollows which comprise the body of a Gillian. Furthermore, the Adjuchas must continue to devour Hollows, or its mind will be absorbed by the other Hollows comprising its form, and it will revert into a Gillian. The subsequent lack of an individual will prevent the reverted Gillian from becoming an Adjuchas again.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Vasto Lorde
                        Are the third classification of Menos. They are extremely rare in number, and it is said that their entire number within Hueco Mundo can be counted with the fingers on one's hands. The combat capabilities of a Vasto Lorde are said to be above those of the captains of the Gotei 13.

                        The process for the creation of a Vasto Lorde is not fully understood. An adjuchas can devour over three thousand hollows and still not evolve into a Vasto Lorde. Some hollow speculate that a Vasto Lorde is determined upon an individual's birth as a Hollow, or perhaps before that. The only known method to become a Vasto Lorde is for an Adjuchas to devour the souls of powerful non-hollows, such as a vice captain.

                        #### Arrancar
                        Is a powerful hollow that has removed its mask, gaining Shinigami-like powers. A Menos usually takes on a Human shape when it becomes an Arrancar. The only ones that will definitely get a 100% Humanoid form are Vasto Lorde-class Menos. For the remaining two levels, there are many who don't get a completely Humanoid form, despite becoming Arrancar. Therefore, the closer one looks to a Hollow, the lower its power of reasoning. There have been Arrancar who have claimed that they gave up their Humanoid forms in order to obtain enormous power.

                        All Arrancar retain a hole in them somewhere, as well as fragments of their Hollow mask known as an estigma. A number of Arrancar have tried to conceal the remnants of their past whilst others choose to hide their faces completely to escape unwanted attention. Most also have a colored marking of some sort on their face, although some only gain these markings upon the release of their Zanpakutō.

                        The Arrancar seal their abilities within the form of a sword. It is entirely different from what Shinigami use. When they release their Zanpakutō's seal, they unleash their true power and their true form. Therefore, an Arrancar's release of their Zanpakutō is merely a temporary restoration to their former selves, granting them any powers their Hollow form possesses. The act of release is called Resurrección (Spanish for "Resurrection"), which is activated with a command phrase followed by the name of the sword.

                        ### Menos Template
                        When a creature becomes a Hollow, apply the following template to it:

                        **Creature Type.** The creature gains the (Hollow) creature type tag.

                        **Hole & Mask.** The creatures chain of fate corroded away leaving behind a hole signifying their heart fading away, and becoming their Hollow mask.

                        **Spell Point Pool.** The hollow gains a pool of Spell Points equal to their HD total plus their proficiency bonus. They regain any spent SP on a long rest.

                        **Ability Score Increase.** One ability score is increased by 2, or two ability scores are increased by 1.

                        **Damage Resistances.** The Hollow has resistance to Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

                        **Darkvision.** The Hollow can see in dim light within 60 feet of it as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. It can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

                        **Hollow Evolution.** The Hollow must eat souls for sustenance. At a minimum, it must eat a number of souls equal to their HD per week.

                        When it eats a soul with HD equal to or greater than its own, its HD amount permanently increases by one and gains a Hollow ability.

                        **Slam.** If the Hollow has no attacks, it gains the Slam natural melee weapon attack. It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

                        **Kūmon.** The Hollow gains the Kūmon ability, regardless if the requirements are met or not. 

                        **Unique Abilities.** The Hollow gains a number of Hollow abilities equal to its HD plus one.

                        > ##### NPC Hollow abilities
                        > DMs, feel free to adjust, modify, or ignore the Hollow Evolution feature as you see fit. Give the Hollow NPC more or less HD and Hollow abilities as needed. Most of the time Hollows will be evolving and getting stronger Off-Screen.

                        ### Hollow Progression
                        When a Hollow reaches the next stage in it's evolution by acquiring the specified number of HD listed on the "Hollow HD Progression Table" it gains the following features or Hollow abilities (whether the prerequisites are met or not) based on which evolution stage it reached.

                        **Gillian.** Base size changed to colossus (any hollow abilities affecting size can be replaced), Cero, Kūmon, Negación, and Swallow Whole. Alternatively you can use the Gillian statblock listed in Chapter 8: Friends & Foes.

                        **Adjuchas.** Base size changed to your choice between Huge or Medium (any abilities related to size can be replaced), Intelligence and Wisdom increased by 2, Negación ability is replaced with any other Hollow ability, and Sonído.

                        **Vasto Lorde.** Base size changes to Medium (any abilities related to size can be replaced) and four Hollow abilities.

                        ### Hollow Player Characters
                        To build a Hollow PC, it is recommended to start as an Adjuchas. To do so you first choose a Non-humanoid creature from the Monster Manual with a CR 3 or less (or another creature approved by your DM) and apply the PC Hollow template to it. You may choose monsters from a different source and/or from a higher CR if allowed by your DM.

                        #### Hollow PC Template

                        **Creature Type.** The creature gains the (Hollow) creature type tag.

                        **Hole & Mask.** Your chain of fate corroded away leaving behind a hole signifying your heart fading away, and becoming your Hollow mask. 

                        **Hit Die Increase.** If your HD amount is less than 10, you gain a number of HD equal to the difference. To increase your HP total you can either roll the HD dice, or take the average.

                        **Spell Point Pool.** You gain a pool of Spell Points equal to your HD total plus your proficiency bonus. You regain any spent SP on a long rest.

                        **Ability Score Increase.** You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

                        **Damage Resistances.** You have resistance to Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

                        **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

                        **Hollow Evolution.** You must eat souls for sustenance. At a minimum, you must eat a number of souls equal to your HD per week.

                        When you eat a soul with HD equal to or greater than your own, your HD amount permanently increases by one and you gain 1 Hollow point. These points stay with you until they are spent.

                        Each time your HD permanently increases from this feature, you can spend any number of Hollow points to gain that many Hollow abilities.

                        **Slam.** If you have no attacks, you gain the Slam natural melee weapon attack. It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

                        **Kūmon.** You gain the Kūmon ability, regardless if the requirements are met or not. 

                        **Unique Abilities.** You gain a number of Hollow abilities equal to half your HD plus three. You can forgo any number of these hollow abilities and gain that many Hollow points.

                        A group of Shinigami are ambushed by an Espada and it's Fraccion. Akihiko engages the Espada, both clash swords and trade swings back and forth, a brilliant display of steel and skill.

                        Izuna releases here Shikai, her sword manifesting into a set of heavy armor and surprises one of the Fraccion member with heavy blows, showing off her hand-to-hand expertise.

                        Akatsuya keeps the final Fraccion member at bay with Shunpo clones and fast attacks, dashing in and out of range, overwhelming her opponent with deadly speed.

                        Ikuto stands in the back casting Kidō. He casts Bakudō #9 Hōrin to stop the advance of a fraccion giving Izuna an opening, he follows that up with Kaido #26 Enlarge to grow Akihiko twice his size, finally after Akatsuya distracts her opponent and gives Ikuto enought time, he finishes off the fraccion member with Hadō #33 Sōkatsui and reduces it to dust.

                        All of these heroes are Shinigami, specialized in one type of combat learned from the academy.

                        ### Duties
                        As a Shinigami you are the guardian of souls, protecting them from Hollows, souls that have been corrupted. These Hollow devour souls and disrupt the balance of reincarnation between Soul Society and the Living Realm. By slaying Hollows with your Zanpakutō, you purify them and send them off into the afterlife, back into the reincarnation cycle.

                        ### Shin'ō Academy
                        As a Shinigami you're a graduate of the Shinōreijutsuin (Spiritual Arts Academy), or more commonly known as the Shinigami Academy. Through their six year curriculum you learned all four major Shinigami combat forms: Hakuda, Hohō, Kidō and Zanjutsu.

                        During this time you excelled and specialized in one of these combat forms.

                        ### Creating a Shinigami
                        As you build your Shinigami, think about two related elements of your character's background: Which combat form will you specialize in? When and how did you discover your high reiryoku? What motivated you to join the academy and become a Shinigami?

                        ## Class Features
                        As a Shinigami, you gain the following class features

                        ### Spellcasting
                        After completing your training at the academy you have learned to manipulate spirit particles to create devastating effects. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter X of this book for the Shinigami spell list.

                        #### Cantrips
                        At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Shinigami spell list. 

                        #### Spell Points
                        The Shinigami table shows how many spell points you have to cast spells at each level. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so. 

                        To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

                        For example, to create a spell slot of 1st level, you would need to expend two spell points.

                        Spells of 3rd level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. Once per long rest, you can create one spell slot of each level of 3rd or higher a number of times, equal to half your proficiency modifier, rounded down.

                        #### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
                        At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Shinigami spell list.

                        Each time you gain a Shinigami level, you can learn one new spell of your choice for free. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Max Spell Level column for your level. 
                        Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Shinigami spell list, which also must be no higher than what's shown in the table's Max Spell Level column for your level.

                        #### Spellcasting Ability
                        Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Kidō. You can use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for Kidō you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                        </font>

                        ### Unarmored Defense
                        While you are not wearing any armor or using a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Proficiency bonus.

                        ### Hakuda
                        Japanese for Hand-to-Hand Combat, Hakuda is a close combat style of fighting, in which one is unarmed and uses only one's body.

                        You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. This die increases as you gain levels, as shown in the Hakuda column of the Shinigami table.

                        ### Shunpo
                        Japanese for Flash Step, Shunpo is a special type of movement technique which allows the user to move faster than the eye can follow.

                        When you would use your normal movement, you can instead use Shunpo. You expend a number of Shunpo feet in increments of 5 feet to teleport that same amount to an unoccupied space you can see. You regain expended Shunpo on a short or long rest. Your Shunpo distance increases as you gain levels, as shown in the Shunpo column.

                        ### Zanpakutō

                        Japanese for Soul Slayer, a Zanpakutō is the main weapon of the Shinigami. The art of weilding one is called Zanjutsu; Japanese for Swordsmanship.

                        When students are accepted into the academy they are given an Asauchi (Shallow Hit). These are nameless Zanpakutō in which the Shinigami has not yet connected too and have no "identity." Over time while the Shinigami wields this weapon, they slowly pour their Spiritual Power into the weapon.

                        In doing so the Zanpakutō develops it's own independent personality. This spirit is a reflection of the owner's soul, as well as it's shape and abilities. Once a Shinigami learns their Zanpakutō's name and release command, they can communicate with one another and grow stronger together. 

                        #### Ability Score Improvement
                        When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1.

                        Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

                        You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.

                        ### Enhanced Durability
                        Beginning at 13th level, when you are reduced to 0 HP and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

                        ### Timeless Body
                        Starting at 17th level, your Spiritual Power causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

                        After dodging a cero, the Quincy draws her bow and lets loose a barrage of arrows at the Hollow. Stilling her mind and maintaining concentration on her bow, she sends one arrow after another to pierce the hollows thick hierro.

                        Within the urban jungle of the city Hollow can lurk within dark alleyways, perched atop a high building, or stalking its prey from the shadows. However, the vigilant Quincy awaits to eliminate any Hollow that dares to show it's face.

                        ### Quincy Cross
                        A cross in the shape of the Quincy symbol that only those who have inherited Quincy abilities and techniques are allowed to possess. This cross is your sealed armament, your Heilig Bogen (Holy Bow).

                        While sealed your cross usually takes the form of a necklace or pendant, but you may choose another form it takes.

                        ### Quincy Archetype
                        At 1st level, you choose an archetype that you follow.

                        Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 7th, 11th and 15th level.

                        ### Unarmored Defense
                        While you are not wearing any armor or using a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Proficiency bonus.

                        ### Reishi Manipulation
                        Reishi is Japanese for spirit particles, it is the main material component of Souls and all spiritual matter. A Quincy uses the Reishi in the atmosphere, and combines it with their own Reiryoku.

                        **Spell Points.** The Quincy table shows how many spell points you have to fuel various abilities. You can't reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

                        **Hirenkyaku.** (Flying Screen Step) It is *special movement* technique, allowing the user to move at high speed by riding on the flow of Reishi created below their feet.

                        When you would use your normal movement, you can instead use Hirenkyaku. You expend a number of your Hirenkyaku feet to teleport that same amount to an unoccupied space you can see. You regain expended Hirenkyaku on a short or long rest. Your Hirenkyaku feet increases as you gain Quincy levels, as shown in the Hirenkyaku column.

                        **Spellcasting Ability.**
                        Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Quincy spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a Quincy spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Quincy spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                        ### Gintō Proficiency
                        Gintō are small containers approximately 5 centimeters in size. You can craft these magic potions by condensing your Reiryoku into a liquid state.

                        If a spell you choose requires a target or to choose a point or area, it would be the subject of the target and centered on them.

                        Gintō can be used as a ranged weapon with a range of 10 ft + 5 ft x your Dex bonus. If used this way, the target doesn't take damage and instead is subject to the effects of the Gintō.

                        * 11th level, three 1st level spells of your choice.

                        ## Arrancar
                        Spanish for "tear off", these group of Hollows gained similar powers to Shinigami by removing their masks. The ritual needed for a Hollow to remove their mask and gain these powers is not fully known.

                        Arrancar are assigned a number from numbers 11 and above indicating the order of their birth.

                        ### Creating a 1st level Arrancar
                        These steps are only if you don't have a pre-existing hollow and you have your GM's permission to create an Arrancar.

                        First, choose a Beast from the Monster Manual (approved by your GM) as your base (any damage immunities, condition immunities, features, and actions are sealed). 

                        Second, apply the Hollow PC template to that creature.

                        Third, if your HD is below 15, you gain a number of HD equal to the difference.

                        Fourth, your creature type is changed to Humanoid, you become bipedal and your size becomes Medium. If your base has additional appendages and legs, those are sealed as well.

                        Finally, pick a Hollow background (wip) and your done.

                        > ##### How strong are Arrancar?
                        > Currently, a 1st level Arrancar should be slightly stronger than an 8th level Shinigami. It is recommended to not have a 1st level party include an Arrancar, unless they're all Arrancar.


                        ### Arrancar Physiology
                        Arrancar not only share similar powers to the Shinigami, but their anatomy as well. When a menos becomes an Arrancar it usually takes on a Human shape. This is defintely true when a Vasto-Lorde class Menos becomes an Arrancar.

                        **Estigma.** Each hollow has a pattern on their face that is unique to them. These tattoo like markings are the remaining part of their mask. Example, Ulquiorra Cifer has tear like markings on his face. Some might only appear during Resurrección.      

                        **Hollow Hole.** The most distinctive characteristic of a Hollow is the hole in their body. It represents the lack of a heart that is difficult to fill. This can be located on almost any area of a Hollow's body.         

                        **Mask Fragment.** Finally, the Hollow has some remnant of their mask that they tore off, somewhere on their head.

                        **Zanpakutō.** An arrancar's Zanpakutō is entirely different from what Shinigami use. A Hollow's true power and their true form is sealed within their Zanpakutō. Therefore, when they release, it is a temporary restoration to their former selves, granting them any powers their Hollow form has.

                        ## Fullbringer
                        Are spiritually-aware Humans born with the eponymous ability Fullbring, which allows them to manipulate the souls that reside in all physical matter. Their powers are constituted by Hollow Reiryoku

                        ### Fullbring
                        This ability enables them to manipulate the souls contained within matter. Everything, even rudimentary objects such as lampposts and chairs possess a soul, however small. By using their power to “pull” on this soul, Fullbringers can manipulate the object's movement or even alter its physical characteristics. For example, by pulling on the soul of water, Fullbringers can walk across its surface without falling through. Many more feats are possible, making the technique highly versatile. Unlike other spiritual beings, Fullbringers use their power with their physical bodies. Because of this, they must train extensively to build up their stamina so they can use it properly. While all Fullbringers are born with this power, the age at which they come to realize it varies. When Fullbringers die, all traces of their abilities disappear from the world. However, they do carry their abilities into the afterlife.

                        ### Creating a Fullbringer
                        As you build your Fullbringer, think about character’s background in regards to your Fullbringer powers: When did your powers manifest? Did this cause any problems? Where your parents also Fullbringers? Did you train alone or did another Fullbringer help you?

                        As a Fullbringer, you gain the following class features

                        ### Fullbring
                        Starting at 1st level, your training allows you to harness your reiryoku. This is represented by a number of Spell Points. Your Fullbringer level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Spell Points column.

                        When you spend SP, it is unavailable until you finish a long rest, at the end of which you regain all expended SP back into yourself.

                        Additionally, you know four Fullbring Arts: Accelerated Strike, Bringer Light, and Slow Fall.

                        ##### Accelerated Strike
                        By spending 2 Sp you can use a Bonus action to empower your next attack. The next unarmed strike you make this turn gets a +2 bonus on the attack roll.

                        ##### Bringer Light
                        By pulling on the soul of the ground you are able to perform this *Special Movement*. When you would use your normal movement, you can instead use Bringer Light. You expend a number of BL feet in increments of 5 feet to teleport that same amount to an unoccupied space you can see.

                        You regain expended BL on a short or long rest. Your BL distance increases as you gain levels, as shown in the Bringer Light column.

                        Additionally, You can spend 2 SP to increase your movement by 10 feet, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

                        ##### Slow Fall
                        By spending 1 SP you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your Fullbringer level.

                        ### Object Afinnity
                        By developing an affinity for a particular object, a Fullbringer can alter its form, granting powers that vary greatly among individuals. This affinity can be defined by one’s love for the object in question, or simply by an overall fondness for it. As such, this power is usually awakened through a strong emotion associated with the object. Using this affinity, Fullbringers pull out the object’s soul and boost it with their own, transforming it in the process.

                        Choose a mundane non-weapon object to be your sealed armament. 

                        \pagebreakNum

                        ### Ability Score Improvement
                        When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1.

                        Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

                        ### Extra Attack
                        Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

                        ### Swift Action
                        Starting at 9th level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can spend 1 SP to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action as a Bonus action on your turn.

                        ### Bonus Feat
                        At 13th level, you gain a generic or Fullbringer feat of your choice.

                        ### Boon
                        At 17th level, you gain a Fullbringer boon of your choice.

                        ### Epic Boon
                        At 20th level, you gain an Epic boon of your choice.

                        ## Fullbringer Archetype
                        At 2nd level, you choose an archetype that you follow. Your archetype choice grants you features at 2nd level and then again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

                        ### Brawler
                        As a Brawler you have trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.

                        #### Living Weapon
                        At 2nd level you gain the following benefits:
                        * You are proficient in Strength saving throws
                        * Your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage
                        * When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action
                        * Whenever you score a critical with an unarmed strike, you regain 1 SP

                        #### Martial Techniques
                        Starting at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th and 18th you learn one martial technique. Whenever you would make an unarmed strike, you can replace it with a martial technique. These are still considered unarmed strikes. Additionally, if you would use the same martial technique consecutively in the same turn, you gain a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll for each consecutive time you've used it.

                        Some of your Martial Techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the techniques effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

                        <!-- <div style='margin-top:20px'></div>
                        
                        <font face='scalysans' size='2'>
                        
                        <center> 
                        
                        **Martial Save DC** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> Your Strength modifier + 
                        
                        </center>
                        
                        <div style='margin-top:-8px'></div>
                        
                        <center> your Proficiency bonus + The number of successful martial techniques this turn </center>
                        
                        <div style='margin-top:12px'></div> -->
                        
                        **Jab (0 SP)** On a hit you deal an extra 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

                        **Cross (1 SP)** On a hit roll 1d4, you deal extra bludgeoning damage equal to the result and regain the same amount of SP.

                        **Hook (1 SP)** On a hit, you deal an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage and your next non-hook martial technique has advantage on the attack roll.

                        **Uppercut (2 SP)** On a hit, you deal an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage.

                        **Roundhouse (3 SP)** On a hit, you deal an extra 1d4 bludgeoning damage. The target makes a Constitution saving throw on a failure they are stunned until your next turn. This ends your Combination this turn.

                        **Haymaker (3 SP)** On a hit, you deal an extra 1d4 bludgeoning damage for each martial technique you've succeeded on this turn. This ends your Combination this turn

                        #### Combination
                        Starting at 6th level you lose the Extra Attack feature if you have it and cannot gain that feature.

                        On your turn, if you use the Attack action with a Martial Technique and succeed, you can spend 2 SP to begin a Combination. You make an additional Martial Technique, if successful you repeat this process until you do not succeed on an attack roll, which ends the Combination.

                        #### Iron Fist
                        Beginning at 10th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

                        #### Critical Blows
                        Starting at 14th level, your unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

                        #### Expanded Technique
                        At 18th level, the following spells and armament abilities are added to the list of Martial Techniques you can choose from:

                        Spirit Blast, Primal Savagery, Shocking Grasp, and Inflict Wounds.

                        ### Assassin
                        You are trained and proficient in the grim art of death.

                        #### Roguish Talent
                        Starting at 2nd level you gain the following benefits:
                        * You gain proficiency in light armor and simple weapons

                        \pagebreakNum

                        * You gain proficiency in Thieves tools
                        * You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws
                        * Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
                        * You can Hide as a bonus action.

                        #### Sneak Attack
                        Begining at 2nd level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

                        You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

                        The amount of the extra damage increases by an additional 1d6 at 6th, 10th, 14th and 18th level to a total of 5d6.

                        #### Evasion
                        Starting at 6th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a Hollows Cero. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

                        #### Supreme Sneak
                        At 10th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

                        #### Blindsense
                        At 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

                        #### Death Attack
                        At 18th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.

                        ### Berserker
                        By pulling on your soul you can enter trance of rage and fury.

                        #### Berserk
                        Beginning at 2nd level, on your turn, you can spend 2 SP and enter Berserk mode as a bonus action.

                        While beserking, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing armor:

                        * You have advantage on checks and saving throws involving Strength or Constitution
                        * If you used the Attack action to make a Melee weapon attack, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action
                        * You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage
                        * If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while berserking

                        Your Berserk mode lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end it on your turn as a bonus action.

                        Once you have berserked, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

                        #### Unarmored Defense
                        Starting from 2nd level, while you are not wearing any armor or wielding a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. 

                        #### Mindless Rage
                        At 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while berserking. If you are charmed or frightened when you berserk, the effect is suspended for the duration. 

                        #### Relentless
                        At 10th level, berserking can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re berserking and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

                        Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

                        #### Retaliation
                        Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

                        #### Primal Champion
                        At 18th level, your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

                        ### Pyschomancer
                        Your Fullbring abilities allow you to physically manipulate the souls of matter to move them at your will.

                        You gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws.

                        #### Psychokinesis 
                        Starting at 2nd level, you can cast the Catapult spell and Mage Hand spell at will. You can cast both spells without verbal or somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand invisible. Additionally, the Mage Hand can carry an additional 5 pounds per your Intelligence modifier.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Telekinetic Spells
                        You learn spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Telekinetic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a Fullbringer spell for you.

                        ##### Telekinetic Spells
                        | Fullbringer Level | Spells |
                        |:-------:|:-----:|
                        |  3rd  | Blade Ward, Mage Hand |
                        |  5th  | Catapult, Shield |
                        |  7th  | Hold Person, Levitate |
                        |  9th  | Tiny Hut, Water Walk |
                        |  11th  | Private Sanctum, Resilient Sphere |
                        |  13th  | Arcane Hand, Wall of Force |
                        |  15th  | Blade Barier, Globe of Invulnerability |
                        |  17th  | Forcecage, Reverse Gravity |

                        **Spellcasting Ability**    
                        Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Fullbringer spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                        Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

                        Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

                        **Spellcasting Focus**  
                        You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your Fullbringer spells.

                        #### Telekinesis
                        At 6th level, you can cast the telekinesis spell at will and without verbal or somatic components.

                        #### Telekinetic Defense
                        At 10th level, you can cast any of your telekinetic spells, that don't deal damage, as a Reaction when you are targeted by a spell or attack.

                        #### Telekinetic Flight
                        At 14th level, you gain a Fly speed equal to your walking speed.

                        #### Telekinetic Singularity
                        At 18th level, as an action you can spend 10 SP to create a  20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force at a point you can see within 60 feet and tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d12 force damage and is pulled in a straight line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pulled.

                        \columnbreak

                        ### Infusionist
                        Through your fullbring, souls of other objects have spoken to you. Allowing you the ability to tinker with items.

                        #### Spellcasting
                        Through intense training you are able to manipulate your Reiryoku to produce spells. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the Human spell list.

                        ##### Cantrips
                        At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Human spell list. 

                        ##### Spell Points
                        Your Fullbringer level determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so. 

                        To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

                        For example, to create a spell slot of 1st level, you would need to expend two spell points.

                        Spells of 3rd level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. Once per long rest, you can create one spell slot of each level of 3rd or higher a number of times, equal to half your proficiency modifier, rounded down.

                        ##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
                        At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Human spell list.

                        Each time you gain a Fullbringer level, you can learn one new spell of your choice for free. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Max Spell Level column for your level. 
                        Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Human spell list, which also must be no higher than what's shown in the table's Max Spell Level column for your level.

                        ##### Spellcasting Ability
                        Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your magic. You can use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

                        In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for spells you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                        You gain the following benefits:
                        * Proficient in Wisdom saving throws
                        * Proficient in simple weapons

                        #### Infusions
                        At 2nd level, you pull on the soul of mundane items and mix in a part of your soul, infusing them with magic. You learn four infusions. You learn two new ones at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

                        After performing a ritual that takes 1 minute and spending the listed amount of SP, you touch a non-magical item and imbue it with one of your infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “Attunement” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

                        Your infusion remains in an item until you finish your next long rest, after that the infusion vanishes.

                        You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at a time; the maximum number of objects is equal to your profiency bonus + 1. Each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.

                        At 6th level you can pull on the soul of an object you hold or your immediate surroundings to gain visions of its past. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a spell.

                        Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

                        **Object Reading.** Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object’s previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.

                        **Area Reading.** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

                        #### Infuse Magic Item

                        ##### Spell Points
                        Your Fullbringer level determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so. 

                        To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

                        For example, to create a spell slot of 1st level, you would need to expend two spell points.

                        Spells of 3rd level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. Once per long rest, you can create one spell slot of each level of 3rd or higher a number of times, equal to half your proficiency modifier, rounded down.

                        ##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
                        At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Human spell list.

                        Each time you gain a Fullbringer level, you can learn one new spell of your choice for free. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Max Spell Level column for your level. 
                        Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Human spell list, which also must be no higher than what's shown in the table's Max Spell Level column for your level.

                        ##### Spellcasting Ability

                        At 6th level you choose another buff and again at 10th, 14th and 18th level.

                        #### Improved Soul Aura

                    Choose one of the Zanpakutō forms, Tanto, Katana or Nodachi, this choice is permanent. As well as one Armament type, you can only choose Shikai abililites from that type.
                    
                    Your Zanpakutō level is the same level as your Shinigami level.
                    
                    #### Konsō
                    Soul Burial is the process by which Shinigami send Pluses to Soul Society from the Human World, which is known as "crossing over". To achieve this, they tap the hilt of their Zanpakutō against a Plus's forehead, leaving an emblem at the point of impact which begins to shine brightly. The Plus proceeds to sink into the ground in a pool of blue light as they are sent to Soul Society, and a hell butterfly flies away from their point of departure.
                    
                    As an action you make a melee attack on a Plus. To resist the Konsō's effect if must make a Constitution saving throw, DC 10 + your level.
                    A Plus is willing and automatically fails it's saving throw if you've completed it's Quest.
                    
                    #### Sublimation
                    When a Hollow is slain with a Zanpakutō, it is cleansed of the sins it committed as a Hollow, and passes into the afterlife. This is called sublimation.
                    
                    Souls who pass into Soul Society will be reborn again into the Human World once their "life" in Soul Society comes to an end. However, if the Hollow committed heinous crimes, it will be sent through the Gates of Hell instead of Soul Society.

                    #### Kengen
                    Your Zanpakutō has developed it's own personality. Your Zanpakutō takes on a more unique appearance. It's scabbard, tsuba, handle or other aesthetics have changed. You learn the name of your Zanpakutō and obtain it's initial release form, also known as Shikai. You gain two armament abilities.
                    
                    You don't simply pick a name, for the living spirit of the Zanpakutō already has its own name. The Shinigami must be able to communicate and harmonize with their Zanpakutō effectively, which requires being able to speak to the spirit within its world. Gaining access to one's Shikai and releasing it for the first time is known as Kengen (Manifestation).
                    
                    To activate this form you must chant a Kaigo (Release Call). Using the Kaigo, followed by the name of the Zanpakutō, activates Shikai. It is crucial to memorize each phrase, as every Zanpakutō has a different Kaigo.
                    
                    As an action you spend 1 SP to activate Shikai. This form lasts for a number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus, which you can dismiss as an action.
                    
                    If your Shikai would be broken or destroyed, as long as their is some part of it remaining, you may restore it. Your Zanpakutō has a number of hit points equal to five times your proficiency bonus. While on you, it uses your AC, otherwise it's 11.
                    
                    ### Shikai Ability
                    At 4th level, you gain two armament abilities, and again at 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level.
                    
                    ### Magic Weapon
                    Starting at 5th level your Zanpakutō counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
                    
                    You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, this bonus increases at levels 9th, 13th and 17th.
                    
                    ### Final Shikai
                    A powerful attack that requires sacrificing your weapon.
                    
                    You gain an Ultimate ability of your choice. Once the chosen ability is used, your Zanpakutō is destroyed. You cannot benefit from any armament abilities while your Zanpakutō is destroyed and cannot activate Shikai or Bankai. Your Zanpakutō takes a number of days to regenerate equal to 10 minus your proficiency bonus.
                    
                    ### Bankai
                    Japanese for final release, it's the final form of a Zanpakutō.
                    
                    To achieve Bankai, one must be able to subjugate their Zanpakutō spirit. Once per day you may enter your "inner world" and attempt to subjugate your Zanpakutō spirit. Your Zanpakutō spirit has the same statistics, Zanpakutō and armament abilities as you.
                    
                    Once your defeat your Zanpakutō, you gain access to Bankai.
                    
                    To activate Bankai you must first be in Shikai. As an action you spend 4 SP and become *Ascended*. You can stay in this form a number of rounds equal to your level plus one. These rounds need not to be consecutive and you can dismiss Bankai as an action, reverting you back to Shikai if you wish.
                    
                    You gain the following benefits while in Bankai.
                    
                    * Your maximum hit points are doubled and you regain 5 hit points per Shinigami level.
                    * You gain an additional armament type and two armament abilities of your choice in the selected armament type.
                    * You gain two additional armament abilities, you only have access to these abilities while in Bankai.
                    * You gain one Ascended ability.
                    
                    Once your Bankai ends, you gain a level of exhaustion.
                    
                    At 15th level and again at 20th level, you gain an Ascended ability and two armament abilities, these additional armament abilities are only available during Bankai.
                    
                    ### Final Bankai
                    This technique is not one that is easily revealed to you by your Zanpakutō. This technique is of tremendous power, but at a great cost. By using this technique, you merge with your Zanpakutō, but afterwards you lose all of your Shinigami powers.

                        #### Hōgyoku
                        Wondrous Item, Artifact

                        This small, bluish-purple orb composed of a unique substance has ability to sense the hearts of those around it and materialize their deepest desire.

                        **Overbearing Power**      
                        The Hōgyoku has the following random properties:        
                        * 2 minor beneficial properties
                        * 2 major beneficial properties

                        **Desire Materialization**      
                        Though initially thought to solely possess the power to control the boundary of the two contravening existences, that of Shinigami and Hollows, this was proven incorrect. Rather, the Hōgyoku's true power is the ability to absorb the desires of those around it and manifest them into reality. However, this power is not without limitations. The Hōgyoku itself is merely a guiding force - it can only manifest the desires of those with the strength to carry them out.

                        Any creature within 60 feet of the Hōgyoku, and is aware of it and it's abilities, can cast Wish  without spending Spell Points or needing material components. A creature can only cast Wish this way once.

                        If a creature is not aware of the Hōgyoku and/or its abilities, its desire is materialized as per the table.

                        | Desire  | Effects |
                        |:---|:-----------:|
                        |  Greed  | You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. |
                        | Rescue | You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.
                        |Protect | You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. |
                        | Regret | You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. |
                        |  Power  | Choose one ability score to increase by +2 or all ability scores to increase by +1 or gain a feat or gain an armament ability |

                        **Hollowfication**          
                        As an action you can target a Shinigami, it gains the Visored supernatural gift and immediately begins their Inner Battle.

                        **Arrancarfication**       
                        As an action you can target a Hollow, it instantly gains a number of HD to meet the HD requirement for the Arrancar class. Additionally, it gains two Hollow abilities and 3 levels in the Arrancar class.

                        **Fusion**      
                        After performing an 8 hour uninterrupted ritual you can embed the Hōgyoku, fusing with it. While imbedded no creature (other than you) can benefit from the Desire Materialization ability. Additionally you get 3 Hollow

                        \pagebreakNum

                        abilities you must spend in the High-Speed Regeneration Hollow ability. The longer you are fused with the Hōgyoku it begins to further understand your heart and restructures your soul and triggers a transformation.

                        **Transformation**      
                        This transformation can widely vary in appearance and abilities. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your transformation.

                        #### Kaikyō Kotei
                        Wondrous Item, Very Rare

                        The Realm Boundary Fixation prongs are special tools used in the Dangai to stop the Kōryū. Normally, lower-echelon Shinigami enter the dimension in great numbers and using a special method, pour in their Reiatsu to fixate the current.

                        However, individuals in possession of significant quantities of Reiatsu can single-handedly suppress the current for extended periods of time, but only after the insertion of four small forked blades into various locations along the Dangai's wall, and as long as the user remains connected to these items for the duration.

                        While the prongs are in place, you are considered Restrained and you must Concentrate. While concentrating, each hour, you must make a Reiatsu check. On a success, the Kōryū remains in place and inert within 40 feet of you. Once you stop concentrating or fail the Reiatsu check you gain a level of exhaustion for each 4 hours you spent concentrating (maximum 5 levels).

                        #### Karakura-Raizer Watch
                        Wondrous Item, Legendary (requires attunement by a Human or Artificial Soul with no class levels)

                        The Karakura-Raizer team was created by Kisuke Urahara to help protect Karakura Town from Hollow attacks. The Karakura-Raizer Watch takes the form of a golden wrist-watch with a "K" on it's face plate and two buttons, one on each side. It also functions as a Denreishinki.

                        There are six total watches, each one uniquely made for its wearer. Additionally, when activated it produces a unique costume for it's wearer.

                        While attuned, the creature can activate the watch as an action, transforming into a Karakura-Raizer. This transformation lasts in increments of 1 minute for a total of 4 minutes. To regain a minute, the watch must be charged for 2 hours (it comes with a charging cable). 

                        When activated, the watch sends out a non-lethal explosion from the watch in a 5-foot radius centered on the creature. Once the explosion clears, the creature is revealed with it's new costume. After stating their Karakura-Raizer name and striking a pose, another non-lethal explosion blossoms behind them for dramatic flare. If the creature doesn't strike their pose and state their name, they are dealt 4d6 electric damage.

                        While active, the creature has access to the following benefits:
                        * The creature gains the Spiritual Awareness racial trait
                        * The creature can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of their unarmed strike
                        * A feat of their choice
                        * Any 10 armament abilities they qualify for (except Hollow abilities)
                        * Max hit points are doubled
                        * They gain 10 bonus Spell Points

                        #### Kikanshinki
                        Wondrous Item, Very Rare

                        The Account-Replacing Spirit Device is a memory substitution device used by Shinigami on creatures that have seen Shinigami or Hollows. The device takes on many different forms, but the most common form is a pez-like dispenser with an animal head that pops up from the top of the device and produces a puff of smoke.

                        The Kikanshinki has 6 charges. With this item in hand, you can use your action to expend any number of charges to cast Modify Memory targeting a single creature per charge expended (spell save DC 15); No components required. 

                        The Kikanshinki regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dusk.

                        #### Leiden Hant
                        Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement by a Quincy)

                        German for Suffering Grip, but more commonly known as the Sanrei Glove, is a white glove which extends up the forearm, stopping two inches from the elbow. This glove can significantly increase a Quincy's power once they've finished training with it, but at a detrimental cost if the glove is ever removed or unattuned.

                        When a Quincy attunes to the Leiden Hant, the training begins. 

                        While attuned, the glove begins to repel reishi, making it difficult to Summon your bow. You must spend an action to summon your bow.

                        The final step requires you to keep your bow from dissipated while simultaneously firing arrows as frequently as possible. You must continuously do this at least 8 hours per day. At the end of each day you must make a Concentration check (DC 16). Once you've succeeded seven times on this check, your training is completed and you gain the following benefits:

                        * Your Heilig Bogen level is considered one level higher
                        * Your Spell Point Pool is increased by a number of points equal to your proficiency bonus + 1
                        * Your Hirenkyaku is increased by 5 feet
                        * You gain access to the Letzt Stil (Last Style) form. As a bonus action, you can remove the glove and enter this form for a number of rounds equal to your level. While in this form, you gain the following benefits: You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Quincy level, your Hirenkyaku is increased by 10 feet and your Heilig Bogen damage rolls are always maxed.

                        Once the duration ends, or you are knocked unconscious or die you lose access to all your Quincy Class Features.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        There is a way for you to regain you powers after removing the glove, though its very difficult. First you must train with another Quincy of equal or greater HD. You must exhaust yourself mentally and physically, then be hit exactly 19mm to the right of your heart with a Heilig Pfeil. Once this happens, a pentacle-shapped scar will form on the point of impact, and your Quincy Class Features are restored.

                        #### Medallion
                        Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires attunement by a Quincy)

                        This device is a thin, metallic round, and palm sized device with the Wandenreich's insignia etched onto it's surface. These are possessed by select members of the Wandenreich military, including all Sternritter. When presented to a single released Bankai, the device emits five streams of dark enery that cause the Shinigami's Bankai to disintegrate. The Bankai is medalized and the victim effectively loses their Bankai, and is left incapable of communicating with their Zanpakutō.

                        While the Medallion is in hand, when a Shinigami release their Bankai, as a reaction you can activate the medallion stealing their Bankai. If the Bankai's owner HD is equal to or less than yours, as an action you can activate their Bankai and use it as if it was your own.

                        While you have a Bankai medalized, you cannot activate Vollständig. Additionally, the medallion is incapable of stealing an Arrancar's Resurrección, or a Shinigami's Bankai if they have Hollow powers.

                        #### Razor wire

                        | Weapon Type | Cost | Damage | Weight | Properties |
                        |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
                        |  Exotic  | 10gp | 1d4 slashing | 1 lb. | Finesse, Two-handed |

                        The Razor Wire is a long spool of thin steel, nearly 8 feet, delicately woven together like a braid resembling a jump rope. It's thick enough to be swung around and be durable, but thin enough to be sharp and concealable. The ends are weighted cylinders of metal, making the weapon ideal for slashing out like a whip.

                        Proficiency with the Razor Wire allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.

                        #### Reiatsu-Concealing Cloak
                        Wondrous Item, Legendary (requires attunement)

                        This cloak functions as a Cloak of Invisibility and also makes your reaitsu undetectable while invisible.

                        #### Reishūkaku (Spirit Core)
                        Wondrous Item, Uncommon

                        The Spirit Core is a medium-sized orb composed of a clear material that is inscribed with a red crane insignia it is created and used by the Shiba Clan. While infused with Reiryoku, the Reishūkaku produces a semi-transparent blue barrier, referred to as a "cannonball", around the one holding it, protecting them from outside forces.

                        The Reishūkaku can also be used in direct combat for protecting the use from enemy attacks, as well as to save oneself from a fall by remaining suspended in midair and floating upward.

                        As an action, you can spend 5 SP to create a 5-foot sphere centered on you, this sphere functions as a Globe of Invulnerability, but requires concentration. At the beginning of each of your turns, you must spend 5 SP to maintain the sphere. Additionally, as a reaction when you would fall, you can activate the Reishūkaku and negate any fall damage.

                        If would lose concentration, the sphere explodes in a 40-foot sphere dealing a number of 1d6 force damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16), on a success taking half damage.

                        #### Ryūkotsujō
                        Rod, Very Rare

                        The Dragon Bone is a long, beige, bone-like rod , with a small, white, bird-shaped skull, and four protrusions, similar to finger bones, extending from the back of the skull. By channeling Reiryoku into the wand, it produces a tentacle, which acts a harness, and a single bat-like wing which acts as a one-handed hang-glider. 

                        While the rod is in hand, you can spend 10 sp any number of times and cast Fly (no components required). The duration lasts for a number of minutes equal to the amount of times you spent 10 sp.

                        #### Seele Schneider (Soul Cutter)
                        Wondrous Item, Rare

                        German for soul cutter, the Seele Schneider is a thin, silver-colored weapon which, when activated, sports a glowing blue blade. It functions much like a chainsaw, with Reishi making 3 million round trips per second around the edge of the blade. Its vibrations loosens the bonds between the Reishi of whatever it cuts in order to make them easier to capture. 

                        The Selle Schneider is used primarily as an arrow, but can be used as a blade which functions as a dagger but deals 1d6 damage instead. The Seel Scheider has it's own SP pool, maximum 20 and starts at 0.

                        Anhäufer: While wielding this item, any time a creature casts a spell, the Seele Schneider gains a number of SP equal to the spells level. Any time a creature uses a spell-like ability, the seele scheider gains 1 SP. The Seele Schneider gains a +1 bonus for each 5 SP it has in it's pool. This bonus is applied to damage rolls when used as an arrow; this bonus is also added to attack and damage rolls when used as a melee weapon. Once used as an arrow, it's SP pool is depleted. The SP pool also depletes after 1 minute or the end of combat, whichever comes sooner.

                        #### Shihōin Shield
                        Wondrous Item, Artifact

                        It is a large, shield-like item with the Shihōin family crest stamped on it, a long cord connected to it and a long rod, and two vertical slots running from its top.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        To utilize this magic item, it requires two Zanpakutō. As an action, make a ranged melee attack against a target within 40 feet. On a success the rod is launched at, and wraps around the target, binding it with the cord. The target is grappled. While the object is grappled, as an action you and an adjacent creature can slot in your Zanpakutō and channel your Reiryoku. The grappled creature takes Xd6 force damage, where x is the combined total HD of both Zanpakutō wielders. If the target is a creature, it is allowed a Constitution saving throw (DC 20) for half damage.

                        The Shihōin Shield cannot be used again until the next dawn.

                        #### Shiken Hakkyōken (Divine Eight Mirror Sword)
                        Weapon (Longsword), Artifact (requires attunement by the head of the Ise Clan)

                        The Divine Eight Mirror Sword is a unique Zanpakutō passed down from generation to generation within the Ise Clan. The Shinken Hakkyōken takes the form of an ornate medium-sized bladeless sword with a flat end. Its "blade" is decorated with four inlaid diamonds, resembling the design commonly found on the wrapped hilt of a katana, and its forte possesses a tassel on either side. Instead of a tsuba, there is an ornate band guard covering an inch of the blade with tassels hanging from either side of it. The handle of Shinken Hakkyōken is only somewhat shorter than the "blade", and possesses two tassels attached to the ring at its end.

                        **Magic Weapon.** This magic warhammer grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

                        **Random Properties.** The sword has the following randomly determined properties, as described in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:

                        * 2 minor minor beneficial properties
                        * 1 major beneficial property

                        **The Ise Curse**. While attuned, your spouse or significant other falls ill and their body degrades rapidly cutting their life span in half. This effect remains even after being unattuned with the Shiken Hakkyōken

                        **Holy Light.** The sword shines so brightly, opponents are only able to view the hilt. You have advantage on attack rolls on creatures that rely on sight.

                        **Divine Reflection.** Whenever a creature makes an attack roll you can spend your reaction to attempt to reflect the attack. When they make their attack roll, but before the result is revealed you make an attack roll. If your roll is equal to or higher than their attack roll you reflect the attack back to the attacker and take damage. If your roll is lower than theirs, you take half damage. Similarly, When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Additionally, if you failed, all creatures within 40 feet of you also take that damage, no save.

                        \columnbreak

                        #### Substitute Shinigami Badge
                        Wondrous Item, Uncommon (requires attunemnt by a Substitute Shinigami)

                        This special badge is given to a Substitute Shinigami as a symbol of acceptance and license to perform duties for the Soul Society. It allows the Soul Society to monitor and restrict the Substitute Shinigami if necessary.

                        The Badge functions as a Gokon Tekkō, but can only affect the user.

                        The Badge alerts the user if Hollows are within 10 miles via an alarm sound which can only be heard by the owner and the item itself is only visible to other spiritually aware beings.

                        #### Sōkyoku (Twinned Punishment)
                        Weeapon (Halberd), Artifact

                        The Twinned Punishment is a large halberd which the Gotei 13 uses at Sōkyoku Hill to execute Shinigami who have severely broken the law.

                        When not in use, the Sōkyoku is sealed by a number of thick ropes wrapped around its pole, which, piercing the ground, hold the halberd in place. During an execution, the Kidō Corps unseals it, causing these ropes to unwind and shoot off away from the hill.

                        As the Sōkyoku activates, emitting an immense amount of flames, it rises into the air, pointing towards the victim, who is held before it by support beams. The flames, enveloping the halberd, reveal its true form; a massive, phoenix-like entity called Kikōō. In this state, the Sōkyoku’s offensive and defensive power is said to be equivalent to that of a million Zanpakutō. As it pierces the victim, this power increases by tenfold, and creates so much heat it vaporizes their soul.

In addition, Kikōō can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. With a touch, Kikōō can also ignite flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried (no action required).
                        > - **Flyby.** Kikōō doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.
                        > - **Illumination.** Kikōō sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet.
                        > - **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Kikōō fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

                        #### Sōshingu (Quincy Bangle)
                        Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement by a Quincy)

                        This old artifact was created to help Quincy with weak Reiatsu, designed to mimic the powers of a Quincy. It forces Reishi to gather, and then amplifies them. In fact, the Reishi will gather even if person using it does not will it. Additionally, it can be used by Quincy to overcome the loss of their powers due to removing the Sanrei Glove. 

                        The Quincy Bangle does have a few technical difficulties while in use. The more powerful arrows take time to get ready, something that would not occur for a normal Quincy Bow, and most of the other arrows have very little power behind them. Also, the Quincy Bangle is fragile and will shatter after a while, sooner when stressed more.

                        The Quincy Bangle has 20 charges, when it is reduced to 0 charges, it is destroyed and crumbles away. If the Quincy Bangle would be reduced to negative charges, it explodes, dealing xd6 force damage to all creatures within 20 feet of it; X is equal to the HD of the user.

                        While attuned the Quincy Bangle provides different benefits:

                        **Depowered Quincy:** Gain access to the following Quincy class features: Quincy Cross, Reishi Manipulation, and Quincy Feats. Additionally, you cannot use a Bow Attribute if you've previously made an attack that turn. When you use a Bow Attribute, you cannot make any further attacks that turn.

                        **Normal Quincy:** Your Heilge Bogen crit range is increased to 19-20 and your Hirenkyaku is increased by 10 feet.

                        When you use a Bow attribute, the Quincy Bangle loses two charges. When you critically strike with your Heilge Bogen, the Quincy Bangle loses three charges.

                        #### Tenshintai
                        Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires attunement by a Shinigami)

                        The Divine Transfer Body belongs to the Onmitsukidō, but invented and tested by Urahara. It is a vaguely Human-shaped, man-sized doll which forcibly materializes the spirit of a Zanpakutō when stabbed by the Zanpakutō. In doing so, it facilitates the user in subjugating the spirit and attaining the Bankai of their Zanpakutō. The materialization can last for three days, after which the spirit reverts into the doll which spawned it. Without this invention, achieving Bankai takes at least ten years, plus the many years of combat experience needed.

                        This method, however, is very dangerous, as normally one would do battle with their Zanpakutō within their inner world, where if they fail, they would not die and can try again. Due to the fact that it forcibly materializes the Zanpakutō's spirit, if the user would fail, they could die. 

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Tentōken (Heaven Stepping Adornment)
                        Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires attunment)

                        The Heaven-Stepping Adornment is a brown mantle, with a large drawstring closure at the collar and a large brooch displaying the Shihōin Clan crest. Like the wand, the Tentōken requires no skill or previous experience to use. It is superior to the wand, since it allows one to hover in mid-air, and does not immobilize one of the user's hands.

                        While attuned, you can spend 5 sp any number of times and cast Fly (no components required). The duration lasts for a number of minutes equal to the amount of times you spent 5 sp.
