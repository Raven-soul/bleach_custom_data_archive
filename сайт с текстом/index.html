These paths sometimes harbor danger and isn’t guaranteed to be safe.

                        **Coordinated Supply Station.** You know where and from whom you can obtain any raw materials, weapons or equipment. Usually, this information comes from a division, a library, or an independent scholar or other learned person, creature or faction.

                        Your DM might rule that the wares you seek is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it simply can’t be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

                        * You're interested in uncovering mysteries as an investigator.
                        * You like playing lawful characters with depth.

                        ### Joining the 6th Division

                        During your time at the Shin'ō Academy you were drawn to the 6th divisions sense of justice, or upholding and enforcing the law is something important to you. Maybe your skills in Bakudō were so great the 6th division tried to recruit you as an arrestor.

                        ### Background: 6th Division Member

                        Patrolling districts, issuing citations, diffusing hostile situations, engaging and combating criminals are only a few situations you will face as a 6th division member.

                        You have the authority to enforce the laws of Soul Society, and that status inspires a certain amount of respect and even fear in the populace. People mind their manners in your presence and avoid drawing your attention; they assume you have the right to be wherever you are.

                        Showing your SPD badge gets you an audience with anyone you want to talk to (though it might cause more problems than it solves when you’re dealing with incorrigible lawbreakers). If you abuse this privilege, though, you can get in serious trouble with your superiors and even be stripped of your position.

                        ### Duties of the 7th Division

                        This division has no special duties other than being the largest army reserve for Soul Society. Since the previous war and other divisions expanded their responsibilities in times of peace, the Soul Society needed a dedicated reserve to respond to threats in times of war. Whether defending off waves of invaders, or to be deployed. The Captain-Commander then held a meeting and asked the captains for one of them to volunteer their division for this role. Without giving any other captain time to consider, Captain Tetsuzaemon volunteered his division.

                        ### Army Reserve

                        All the members of the 7th division constantly train, as they must be vigilante and ready to deploy at a moments notice. They have many garrisons scattered across the Soul Society and the Human Realm.

                        With the 7th division being mostly male, the 8th Division is predominately female, due to the previous Captains recruitment priorities. This division embodies femininity, strength, elegance, sophistication and discipline.

                        During times of peace after the war, the rudimentary monetary system was in shambles. Loan sharks began to rise and gain great power and influence. Many conflicts started to arise and at one point gangs were a much more larger threat than a hollow incursion. With this problem in mind the Captain-Commander appointed the 8th Division to handle this problem, thus the Seireitei Central Bank was formed.

                        ### Duties of the 8th Division

                        The 8th division functions as Soul Societies central bank. They promote the health of the economy, conduct monetary policy, supervise and regulate banks, maintain financial stability, mint new coins when needed, and ensures the Gotei 13 receive their funding. 

                        ### Seireitei Central Bank

                        The SCB is divided into three departments that work together. Each one headed by lieutenant, 2nd seated officer or 3rd seated officer.

                        The first branch is the Operations Branch. This is the bulk of the division which consists of bank tellers, clerks, marketing representatives, internal auditors, branch managers and loan officers. These individuals handle the most prominent job duties the division is responsible for.

                        The second department is the Minting Department. They manufacture the coins used for currency. 

                        The third department is the Financial Research Department, which consists of economists, financial researchers, financial analysts and bank examiners.

                        You know where and from whom you can obtain funding, whether this be in currency, assets or services. Usually, this comes from banks, nobles, or an independent investor or other faction. Knowing where the funding can be found doesn’t automatically enable you to acquire it; you might need to offer collateral, business plans, favors, or other incentives to invest into your venture.

                        Your DM might rule that the funding you seek is too much, would require multiple investors, or your venture is too outlandish for any savvy business person to invest in.

                        The 10th division is one of the most welcoming divisions among the Gotei 13. Those who wish to constantly refine their skills and learn will find that opportunity here. 

                        Previously, Naruki City was under the jurisdiction of the 10th division, but after the war many roles, and duties were shuffled rearranged or consolidated. That city was consolidated under the 5th divisions duties. 

                        With Central 46 focusing more on governing Soul Society less focused was placed on the Academy. The Captain-Commander then nominated the 10th division to assist with managing the school.

                        ### Duties of the 10th Division

                        The primary duty of the 10th division is to govern the Shin'ō Academy. The 10th division ensures the academy is responsive to the values, beliefs and priorities of the Central 46 and Soul Society. They are responsible for staffing the academy, protecting it, providing support for students and setting the curriculum.

                        An additional role of the 10th division is to scout out and recruit souls to take the Shinigami Aptitude Test and increase the numbers of the Gotei 13.

                        ### Shin'ō Academy
                        The Shinōreijutsuin (Spiritual Arts Academy), now just called the Shinigami Academy, was an institution founded by Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto over 2,000 years ago. 

                        The Academy is a sprawling, multiple story building with architecture similar to that of Seireitei. It has an open courtyard, many classrooms, dormitories and practice areas for Zanjutsu, Hakuda, Hohō, and Kidō. The commandment all Shinigami are taught at the Academy is *"Do not seek beauty in battle. Do not seek virtue in death. Do not make the mistake of considering only your own life. If you wish to protect that which you must protect, slice the enemy you must defeat from behind."*

                        The Academy does not teach students to fight for the sake of their superiors or family. Instead they're taught that a Shinigami should give their life to protect their friends and humanity.

                        #### Uniform
                        The uniform of the Academy is similar to the standard Shinigami shihakushō uniform, but with a different color scheme. The women's style consists of a red shitagi (under shirt), a white kosode (shirt) with red stripes, red hakama (trousers), white socks and sandals.

                        For the male version of the uniform, the red is replaced with blue. There is a circular symbol on both breasts of the outer shirt. This appears to be the emblem of the Academy.

                        #### Admission
                        Applicants to the academy must pass an entrance exam in order to be admitted, and must demonstrate that they have some Reiatsu. The entrance exam is open to any and all who wish to apply, resulting in a wide range of individuals of all ages joining.

                        The social classes of the applicants range from nobles and residents of the more hospitable districts of Rukongai to its more barbaric outer regions. The results of the entrance exam are used to divide up the successful applicants into different classes, with those who obtain the highest grades being placed in the first class.

                        At the start of the academic year, there is a welcoming ceremony for the new students.

                        #### Curriculum
                        The Academy's curriculum is taught over six years, though exceptionally gifted students have been known to graduate from the academy in less time than this. In addition to a more general education, the pupils are taught how to control and make use of their Reiatsu, as well as the four major Shinigami combat forms: Hakuda, Hohō, Kidō, and Zanjutsu. Students also learn how to perform Soul Burials, how to communicate with the spirit of their Zanpakutō, and are prepared for the general duties of a Shinigami. Upon completing the Academy's curriculum, a student will then apply to join a division of the Gotei 13.

                        The 11th Division is a direct-combat Division with a specialization in swords-only combat, forgoing the other Shinigami arts and thereby being one of the most specialized divisions in the Gotei 13. As such, it is common practice for members to be carry their Zanpakutō at all times. Since the rise to captain status of the current Kenpachi, an unofficial rule has been added that says to be a true member of the Eleventh Division, one's Zanpakutō must be a melee-type.

                        The division's doctrine of dominating in battle is what appeals to its members; they believe that fighting is what makes life worth living. This is what separates the 11th Division from the others and makes them the strongest division. Everyone in the 11th Division are highly skilled in fighting. They believe if they are going to die anyway, they have to go down fighting gloriously.

                        The division is also set up so that to become the captain of the Eleventh, the candidate must do so through the third method of becoming a captain, killing the previous captain in front of 200 members of the Division.

                        ### Duties of the 11th Division

                        After the war, Zaraki expressed his disappointment and irritation on the amount of casualties the Gotei 13 suffered. He took it upon himself to "properly" teach Zanjutsu to the Gotei 13 members. Though his methods are severe and intense, the results have allowed him to continue. Although after a certain incident with a cocky student losing a limb, Zaraki was only allowed to personally instruct "Advanced Prodigy Pupils;" almost nobody has achieved this pseudo rank, for their own good.

                        Their first role is conducting weekly Zanjutsu drills for all Gotei members seated 5 and below to keep their swordsmanship sharp at all times.

                        Their second role is providing all of the Zanjutsu instructors and the Zanjutsu portion of the curriculum for the academy.

                        ### Zaraki Corps

                        The Zaraki Corps is a special operations force of the Gotei 13. This group consists of the Captain, lieutenant and seats three and four.

                        Additionally, they host a grand tournament once a year for **all** Gotei 13 members and non-shinigami to test their might and skills. With the finalist winning some grand prize, usually money, or the chance to take on the Captain to take his role and the title of Kenpachi. Everyone so far has taken the money. However, Byakuya did enter the tournament once just to challenge Kenpachi, though the Captain-Commander suggested he take the money, for the safety of the attendants and frankly, Soul Society.

                        The 13th division like the 2nd division, 10th division and 12th division has had separate entities merged together. The Kidō Corps became part of the 13th division and it's duties broadened and strengthened. The division now regulates anything Kidō within Soul Society.

                        ### Duties of the 13th Division

                        The 13th division is the primary source for kidō instructors and kidō curriculum for the academy. They're also where one would go to further study and research kidō. Would be students aspiring to become kidō masters or create new kidō will find the resources and guidance to do so here.

                        Their second duty is regulating the usage of kidō. They dictate which kidō should be taught, studied, researched, restricted, or forbidden.

                        ### Kidō Corps

                        The Kidō Corps is a group of specialists presiding over spiritual law. Much like the 2nd division its operations are executed in absolute secrecy.

                        The Kidō Corps have three main known functions. The first is investigating and prosecuting kidō related crimes, and establishing laws regarding kidō.

                        The second is releasing the Sōkyoku seal during executions.

                        The third is opening the Senkaimon. The Senkaimon is the gate used to travel between Soul Society and the Human Realm, and is the only official and safe way to enter and leave Soul Society. Soul Society has only one permanent Senkaimon, which takes the form of a giant gate situated within a large courtyard atop a large tower. Travel through the Senkaimon is heavily regulated, and can only officially be opened by the members of the Kidō Corps. A black winged insect, the Jigokuchō, which only Shinigami are permitted to carry, is needed to pass through it.

                        Upon arriving and leaving from the Human World, the Senkaimon can appear almost anywhere. When it appears in this fashion, the Senkaimon takes the form of a traditional Japanese waiting room entered through a Shōji. It can be opened by using a Zanpakutō as a key. The method requires simply placing the Zanpakutō in front of the user and inserting it into the spacial area one wants the Senkaimon to appear before turning the sword like a key while declaring "Kaijō!" (unlocking). Intruders can pass through the Senkaimon, but the lack of a Jigokuchō forces intruders to pass through the Dangai.

                        # Royal Guard

                        The Royal Guard, also known as the Zero Division, is dedicated to the protection of the Soul King, the Royal Family, and the Soul King Palace. The Royal Guard is a special organization that performs services for the Royal Family. It has a considerable amount of fighting, organizational, and executive power compared to other divisions.

                        Since serving the royal family is the primary purpose of the Royal Guard, they do not interfere in Gotei 13's affairs and the defense of Soul Society, even against major threats like Aizen and his Arrancar. They are known to do whatever is required by order of the Soul King.

                        The Royal Guard's authority supersedes the authority of all within Soul Society. Each member of the Royal Guard have had the power of the Ōken imparted onto their bones by the Soul King. They also each have a city of their own at the Soul King Palace.

                        The Royal Guard commonly stays within the Soul King Palace, but when they do travel, their preferred method of transportation is a huge pillar called the Tenchūren (Heavenly Pillar-Palanquin). This pillar enters from the inner dimension and lands with significant force upon its arrival. The Tenchūren, however, does not have the ability to return to the palace on its own, and relies on Kūkaku Shiba's cannon to launch it back.  Additionally, there is the Chōkaimon (Super World Gate), but it can only be opened by syncing the arrival and departure times. The final and least used form of transportation is the interdimensional stairs that lead to the Seireitei, though it will take anywhere from half a day to a week of travel to get there.

                        Like the divisions of the Gotei 13, the Royal Guard has a unique symbol that represents the division's primary role, which is in its case based upon the Winter Daphne (Jinchōge). This symbol is placed inside the Gotei 13 symbol of a rhombus to form the division's complete insignia, which is displayed upon each member's haori.

                        ### History

                        Due to their status as a secret organization, the history and very existence of the Royal Guard is not commonly known. 

                        Many believed them to be a myth up until they arrived when the Quincy invaded.

                        ### Structure

                        The Royal Guard is known to promote former captains of the Gotei 13 to their ranks. The Royal Guard has no soldiers, and it only has 5 members, all of which are former captains. Their total power far surpasses the power of all the 13 Divisions together.

                        All the members of the Royal Guard were Shinigami acknowledged by the Soul King to have made significant contributions to the history of Soul Society.

                        # The Wandenreich

                        After losing the war with the Shinigami 1,000 years ago, the Quincy escaped from the Human World into the Seireitei, the place they believed to be the most unguarded. In doing so, they used Reishi to create space in the "shadows". This is what was called the Wandenreich, the "Invisible Empire". Their plan was to use the abundant Reishi that was only to be found in Soul Society as the source of their power, so they hid and waited for 1,000 years while gathering their power.

                        Sometime after the defeat of Sōsuke Aizen, the Wandenreich conquered Hueco Mundo, capturing Tier Harribel in the process. In addition, they conscripted many Arrancar into their service and killed many Hollows.
                        With the defeat of Ywach and most of their fighting force the Wandenreich was left in disarray.

                        ### Structure

                        Much like the Gotei 13, the Wandenreich has a rigid and defined hierarchy.

                        #### Emperor
                        The leader and undisputed ruler of the Wandenreich who has absolute control and say.

                        #### Sternritter
                        The Star Knights is a group of elite Quincy combatants led by the Sternritter Grandmaster. Several Sternritter are appointed as the emporer's elite guards, known as the Schutzstaffel (Imperial Guards), led by the Schutzstaffel Grandmaster.

                        #### Jagdarmee
                        The Hunting Corps is a hunting unit which, in the wake of Hueco Mundo's conquest by the Wandenreich, is entrusted with capturing Arrancar to serve the empire. The Jagdarmee is separated into numbered groups. The Executive Hunting Captain being the leader of the first Jagdarmee.

                        #### Soldat
                        The soldiers of the Wandenreich that make up most of the army. They can defeat low-ranked Shinigami with ease.

                        ### Rank and Renown

                        By gaining renown as a member of the Wandenreich, you can ascend through an ordered series of ranks within the faction. Promotion always requires the approval of a superior officer. It is a reward for services rendered to the orgranization, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.

                        In addition, certain positions become available to you when both your renown and your character level reach certain thresholds.

                        \columnbreak

                        #### Rank 1: Soldat (Soldier)

                        *Prerequisite: Renown 1 or higher*

                        At this rank you are part of a platoon of soldiers. You embark on routine missions and low threat missions.

                        You salary allows you to sustain a Modest lifestyle.

                        #### Rank 2: Feldwebel (Sergeant)

                        *Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher*

                        At this rank, you gain some authority over a few Soldat. When you undertake a mission on the faction’s behalf that requires military strength, a squad of 1d4 soldiers (your DM has the stats) accompanies and assists you for the duration of the mission.

                        #### Jäger (Hunter) [Special Role]

                        *Prerequisite: Rank 1, Renown 3 or higher and 5th level of higher*

                        If you meet the prequiresites, you can apply to join the elite group known as the Hunting Corps. This special order serves as a combination of military police and military intelligence, giving it a fair degree of independence within the faction. Its members scout the activities of other factions to assess their military strength, predict potential threats, capture and interrogate individuals and they sometimes activate squads to defuse threats before they grow more serious. The Jägers also help the Wandenreich root out spies and leaks within the faction. Secondarily, the Jäger is responsible for policing the ranks of the army. When members get carried away by their zeal and break the law or abuse their authority, the Jäger take on the tasks of investigating, apprehending, and punishing the malefactors. Similarly, if members of the army disappear (involuntarily or otherwise), Jäger agents are typically the ones called to investigate.

                        #### Rank 3: Brigadier

                        *Prerequisite: Rank 2 and Renown 5 or higher*

                        As a brigadier, you are responsible for missions and strategies that you can’t execute entirely on your own or with the aid of a handful of soldat. After receiving goals handed down from the captain above you, it’s your job to figure out the tactics needed to accomplish those goals.

                        You lead a brigade that consists of six squads, each made up of four soldat commanded by a Feldwebel (use the soldier stat block). You can assign these squads to tasks of your choosing within the area you have authority. You can also lead these soldat into battle yourself, or bring one squad and its sergeant with you on a sanctioned mission.

                        You continue to receive a salary sufficient to maintain a modest lifestyle, but your quarters in the garrison are more spacious.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Silbern Guard (Special Role)

                        *Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher and 7th level or higher*

                        Members of the Silbern Guard are responsible for the defense of Silbern, the Wandenreich headquarters. Only those who have proven themselves in combat are selected to join this force. If you are accepted into the Silbern Guard, your missions will be primarily defensive in nature. You might receive orders to find new ways to fortify the fortress or to detect moles and other spies who try to gain access. Of course, given these chaotic times, you could end up defending Silbern from an all-out attack by some other enemy force.

                        #### Rank 4: Oberst (Colonel)

                        *Prerequisite: Rank 3 and Renown 10 or higher*

                        As a Oberst in the Wandenreich, you gain command of a small garrison and the responsibility for maintaining order and protecting people in part of a city district. You have four brigades under your command. As described for rank 3, each brigade has six squads of five soldat (including a Feldwebel) reporting to them. One additional squad of 2d4 soldat is your personal retinue.

                        You regularly receive communications from the Sternritter who coordinate the efforts of the smaller garrisons. They keep you informed of the goals and concerns of the Emperor and can help you address them. You are then responsible for giving orders to your brigadiers, and you must answer to your Sternritter for the troops’ success or failure in achieving the army's strategic goals.

                        As a Oberst, your salary allows you to maintain a comfortable lifestyle between adventures.

                        #### Sternritter (Special Role)

                        *Prerequisite: Rank 3, Renown 15 or higher and 10th level or higher*

You are in regular communication with the Emperor, who places you in charge of a major faction initiative. You might be tasked with improving recruitment, developing a plan for dealing with another faction, or collaborating with one, as well as leading an invasion.

                        At this rank, you gain a Sternritter Medallion (described in chapter X) at the start of each mission you undertake on the faction’s behalf. You draw a salary sufficient to maintain a wealthy lifestyle.

                        #### Thronfolger (Heir to the Throne) [Special Role]

                        *Prerequisite: Rank 4, Renown 25 or higher and 15th level or higher*

                        This position can only be bestowed by the Emperor. Your power, skillset, or mind has been acknowledged by the Emperor and they decided on you as their successor in the event of their death, or when they step down. 

                        At this rank you are under the wing of the Emperor as they familiarize you with their duties, from managing the Sternritter, to running the country.

                        # Xcution

                        Xcution is a secret society initially assembled under the founder and former Substitute Shinigami Kūgo Ginjō. This faction is a haven for those persecuted or wronged in one way or another due to their Fullbring powers and to master their abilities.

                        ### History

                        Kūgo initially formed the group to rob Ichigo Kurosaki of his latent Shinigami powers and share it amongst the group. Once his plan utterly failed most of the group was slain by the Shinigami. The surviving members disbanding and scattering.

                        After some time the members regrouped and decided to reform Xcution and keep its initial mission. For funding they also perform mercenary work. They quickly grew in power and became a much more structured faction mirroring the Gotei 13. 

                        Through the years Xcution and the Gotei 13 would sometimes work together, but their relationship, due to their history together, has been tenuous at best. More often they would clash, as Xcution has made the existence of Hollow's, Shinigami and other factions more known. Xcution believes that the more people know of Hollows, the easier it would be to monitor and protect the Human Realm. The Gotei 13 would see the dismantling of the Xcution, but the additional help they provide with protecting the Human Realm as well as the other realms, they more often turn a blind eye. This however, doesn't reassure Xcution and ensure they not only have the numbers to combat them if necessary, but technology to match them.

                        ### Structure

                        The entire faction is led by a council of 5 Magistrates, known as the Senatorum. All Magistrates were previously a Primaris who were elected as a Magistrate by the Senatorum.

                        Unlike the Gotei 13, the diferrent sectorums of Xcution work tightly and coherently together. They freely share information, contacts and other assets for the benefit of each other and the faction.

                        ### Sectorum Munitorum

                        This sectorum is one of the largest of the faction. They handle the administrative and bureaucratic duties of the faction. Additionally, they also perform many other important maintenance duties for the factions facilities and assets. 

                        The Sectorum also trains and licenses scribes, notaries, interpreters, cartographers, barristers, heralds, bookbinders to it's clients.

                        ### Sectorum Custodia

                        This sectorum brokers the services of bodyguards, mercenaries, and bounty hunters. They specialize in risk assessment and management, protecting clients from physical threats.

                        The Sectorum also patrols the Human realm warding off Hollow and being the eyes and ears for the faction.

                        ### Sectorum Obscura

                        This sectorum provides covert operation services, as well as assisting clients in protection against such operations. The sectorum licenses spies, assassins, locksmiths, security specialists, and more.

                        They also compile many dossiers on individuals, groups, or other factions to blackmail or as a deterrent to maintain Xcutions secrecy, safety and power.

                        ### Sectorum Cerebra

                        This sectorum focuses on science and research on reishi, hollow, other races as well as the mechanics and potential of fullbringers. They also research, craft and sell Kidō infused items.

                        Additionally, this is the sectorum new recruits go to to train, develop, and discover their Fullbring powers.

                        For income, this sectorum also consists of many artisans which provides a variety of goods and services to clients.

                        ### Sectorum Vitamora

                        This sectorum manages various establishments that provide healing and medicinal goods and services, both mundane and magical. Additionally they're also mystics that can help clients commune with the recent dead as well as perform Konsō rituals. These mystics also find spirits and assist them in passing over.

                        As a Primaris you are placed in charge on a Sectorum. New sectorums rarely form, so you must wait for your sectorum primaris to retire (one way or another) before a position exists for you to fill, except in truly exceptional circumstances.

                        # El Reino Hueco

                        Spanish for The Kingdom of Hollows. This Kingdom was initially united and formed by Baraggan Louisenbairn. Through his might he was able to unite every arrancar in Hueco Mundo under his rule, and for those that would not bow to him, would be destroyed. After some time he became the undisputed King of Hueco Mundo and the original ruler of Las Noches. However, after some time he became bored as a result of nothing to do, nothing to conquer, and no one to defeat, thus rendering his army nearly useless: its only purpose had become awaiting the invasion of another force.

                        After Aizen's defection, he made his way to Hueco Mundo and sought out Baraggan and quickly usurped him as King. Aizen kept Baraggan alive under the condition he served him. After Aizen's defeat and baraggan's passing, Tier Harribel, previously the third Espada, took over as the new King of Hueco Mundo and ensured the continued unification of all the arrancar.

                        ### Structure

                        Unlike the Gotei 13, the Espada, and the rest of the forces of Hueco Mundo are a collective of individuals and groups only organized together by the might of the current ruler of Hueco Mundo. Each Esapada member has their own quarters within Las Noches. They're also left to their own devices to do as they want as long as it doesn't disrupt the king's plans or cost harm any other Espada or Números.

                        #### Números
                        Spanish for numbers. The moment a hollow is "reborn" into an arrancar, they are conscripted into the King of Hueco Mundos army. Each one is assigned a two-digit number, starting with 11. This number indicates not the order of the Números' strength, but of their birth. Thus, the higher an Arrancar's number, the younger they are.

                        #### The Exequias

                        Spanish for Funeral Rites. This group cleans up after each battle, performs reconnaissance and data collection, and terminates any rebels or intruders in Las Noches, hence their name. 

                        This group was founded and lead by Rudbornn Chelute, the 61st arrancar. For most of it's existence, he was also it's only member, as all of his subordinates were created by his abilities.

                        #### Fracción

                        Spanish for fraction, are Arrancar that serve a specific Espada. As proof of their status, the Espada have the right to select subordinates from among the Números to supervise directly. They can choose one or many Fracción, or even none at all.

                        #### Espada

                        Spanish for sword, the original Espada was formed by Baraggan Louisenbairn, the previous King of Hueco Mundo.

                        This elite fighting force assisted him in leading his armies and conquered all of Hueco Mundo and established Las Noches as his palace.

                        The Espada are the ten top-ranked and most powerful Arrancar in Heuco Mundo controlled by the King of Hueco Mundo. Members of the Espada are given a number from 0-9. The lower the number, the more powerful the Espada. Each Espada has a tattoo with their number somewhere on them.

                        Only Vasto Lorde's can become an Espada, they're either added to the ranks by the current ruler, or they can challenge a current Espada to take their spot. If an Espada would be demoted they become a Privaron Espada and their number increases by 100.

                        Their immense power and leadership status among the Arrancar also grants each Espada the authority to exert command over the King's other forces within Las Noches: the Números, the Exequias, and their own Fracción, chosen by them from the Números.

                        #### Rank 1: Número
                        *Prerequisite: Renown 1 or higher*

                        As a Número you perform menial tasks by whichever higher ranking arrancar demands of you. You have a room within the large barracks in Las Noches.

                        #### Rank 2: Exequias 
                        *Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher*

                        You have proven yourself as a useful Número and have been promoted to the Exequias. No longer performing menial tasks, and fulfilling the tasks of the Exequias you are given greater responsibility, but you are still subordinate to any higher ranking member.

                        #### Rank 3: Fracción 
                        *Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher*

                        You have further proven yourself and have been recruited by an Espada to be a part of their Fracción. Your duties now consist of whatever your Espada assigns you too.

                        #### Rank 4: Espada 
                        *Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher*

                        You have become an Espada, from either defeating an Espada member to take their place, or from a vacancy opening up and being promoted by the King. As an Espada there is no greater authority than the King of Hueco Mundo. You are free to do as you'd like, so long as you follow any laws & rules of your King and you obey and protect the King as well.

                        You're also allowed to recruit from the Números to create your own Fracción. You're Fracción maximum size is 1 + your Charisma modifier and your Fracción total combined CR is equal to your level/HD + 1 and no Fracción member can be of equal level, HD or CR as you.

                        #### Rank 4: King of Hueco Mundo 
                        *Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher*

                        As the King of Hueco Mundo you are free to rule as you see fit. You control all Espada and Las Noches.

                        # Chapter 3: The Planes of Bleach
                        Within this chapter you'll find information on the various planes (or realms) of Bleach. Each one unique with it's own rules, denizens and dangers.

                        ### The Garganta
                        Spanish for "Throat", it is the space between realms. It is a featureless black void of turbulent and unstable Reishi. To move through it, travelers must create footholds using the Reishi or fall into the void and be lost forever.

                        #### The Valley of Screams
                        Valleys of Screams are pockets of space, varying in size, that reside within the Garganta. These demiplanes form from souls ejected from the reincarnation cycle and coalesce into a small realm. How and why these form is currently unknown.

                        ### The Living Realm
                        Otherwise known as the Human realm, it is the material plane of that as we knew it, Earth during the 2000's.

                        ### Dangai
                        Also known as the Precipice World, is a corridor-like demiplane in the Garganta that connects Soul Society and the Human Realm. Origninally, the Dangai was not only a passage to the Human realm, but a penal colony. This realm is an isolated space which is surrounded by numerous stacked-up layers of time's current, making it a temporally dense realm when compared to others. It is approximately 2,000 times denser, meaning that when one hour passes in the outside worlds, about 2,000 hours pass inside the Dangai.

                        The Kōryū and Kōtotsu are remnants of it's time as a penal colony and also act as a defensive mechanism against unwanted intruders. While the Dangai can be used to journey to and from Soul Society, those who have a Jigokuchō bypass this realm entirely.

                        The Kōryū (Wresting Flow) is the current that is constantly flowing through the Dangai, in order to prevent enemies from using it. This current takes the form of a thick sludge. The current stops those from moving, even if one foot is caught in it, escape is almost impossible. The current encompasses the floor, walls and ceiling.

                        The Kōtotsu (Wresting-surge) is the Dangai's equivalent to a street sweeper. It is made of the same material as the Dangai and appears similar to a bullet train with a bright golden eye at the upper-center of its body. The Kōtotsu appears every seven days to cleanse the area - killing anyone and everything it makes contact with it. This assures that no one lingers in the realm and takes advantage of the time distortion.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        ### Soul Society
                        Also known as the Spirit Realm, this plane is an afterlife where most souls go to and dwell until they're reincarnated into the Human Realm. While the denizens refer to it as Soul Society, this area is actually the East Branch of a larger Soul Society. The mode of life in Soul Society closely resembles that of feudal Japan.

                        When people die, they are assigned a number to a part of Soul Society according to when they died. Denizens never hunger here (unless they have spiritual powers) and lifespans of 2000 or more years are not unheard of. While some would describe this as a paradise, it is far from sublime. Life here is much like that of the living world. Children can be born the same way as in the Human Realm. People can also be killed as regular Humans, though they are capable of surviving wounds that would normally be considered fatal. A soul that dies in Soul Society is reincarnated on Earth as a new Human with no past memories.

                        Shinigami enter and leave Soul Society by unlocking the Senkaimon and using a Jigokuchō. Pluses can also enter Soul Society through Konsō. Intruders can pass through the Senkaimon in the same manner, but only in soul form. This allows spiritual beings, such as Ichigo in his Shinigami form, to enter without permission. Humans can also use such a gate through the use of Reishihenkanki (Spirit Exchangers), which convert solid matter into Reishi. Finally, Hollows can also directly rip a hole to Soul Society from Hueco Mundo, or in the case of Arrancar, using Garganta.

                        One of the more unusual aspects of Soul Society is its technology level. While the lifestyle and culture of Soul Society is comparable to feudal Japan, they possess technology of a level exceeding that time period. The Shinigami Research Institute has developed amazing technology to their credit, mixing technology with organic components. Allowing for the creation of creatures that do everything from detecting spiritual energy signatures to allowing Humans to see a spirit without the use of a Gigai. They possess touch-screens and databases which are in use for files and historical documentation storage found extensively in the Daireishokairo (Great Spirit Book Archive), which contains all the knowledge and history of Soul Society. View screen technology that is capable of sending signals to the Human World and Dangai, allowing for face to face conferencing. All manner of portable hand-held devices for tracking and communication purposes. Blending old traditions and ideas with new innovation, Soul Society is an enigma in this comparison.

                        #### Government
                        Soul Society is maintained by the Soul King whose existence is pivotal to the balance of the world as it regulates the flow of souls into and out of Soul Society, leaving administration to the Central 46 Chambers and Nobles. The Soul King lives at the Royal Palace in a demiplane separated from Soul Society itself and protected by the Royal Guard. The demiplane can only be accesssed with an Ōken (King's Key) The supposed location of this Ōken is passed down verbally from one Gotei 13 Captain-Commander to the next.

                        Another part of the government are the Noble Houses, especially the Four Noble Families which are considered to be the highest of them all.

                        The lower noble houses all serve one of the four. The military have no authority to act against a noble family without evidence that their actions are treasonous.

                        The Central 46 is an organization that serves as the judiciary authority of the Soul Society. Operating under a mandate from the Soul King, the influence of the Central 46 goes well beyond the boundaries of a judiciary authority and into those of legislative and operative authorities. The Central 46 is comprised of forty wise men, gathered from all over the Soul Society, and six judges. These men are in charge of trying all Shinigami crimes, whether they were committed in Soul Society or not. The Central 46 are also within their jurisdiction to order the use of deadly force by the military.

                        #### Seireitei
                        The Court of Pure Souls, is in the center of Soul Society. Seireitei is a circular shiro with four main entrances, ten days walk apart, each guarded by one of the Gatekeepers, elite members of incredible size. These gates are collectively called the Four Great Pure Soul Gates: these gates are made up of the Northern Black Ridge Gate, the Eastern Blue Stream Gate, the Southern Red Hollow Gate, and the Western White Road Gate. The gates are so heavy that it takes the full might of a gatekeeper to lift one. There are, however, doors within the gates, to allow passage of individuals when needed.

                        The walls of the Seireitei, known as the Seireiheki (Pure Soul Wall), are made of Sekkiseki (Spirit Reducing Stone), a rare type of stone known to negate all Reiryoku. The stone also forms a spherical barrier around the city, extending above and below, stopping anything spiritual from breaching it from ground level, from the sky or from underground. The wall that surrounds the Seireitei is commonly held up, only closing down when there is an emergency. When it is not down protecting the Seireitei, the wall protects the Soul King Palace.

                        The majority of the residents of Seireitei, nobility and Shinigami alike, do not interact with the citizens of Rukongai. The Central 46 chambers, the Shini'o Academy and all Gotei 13 divisions are located within the Seireitei.

                        #### Rukongai
                        Drifing Spirit town, is the largest portion of Soul Society and the most populated. It is divided into 320 districts (80 in North Rukongai, 80 in West Rukongai, etc.), each numbered in descending order on how far they are from the center; this results in the higher-numbered (and farther) districts decaying into slums. Thus, while District 1 is peaceful and lawful, much like the antiseptic lifestyle of early-Edo Era Kyoto, District 80 is a hardscrabble, violent, crime-infested area that more depicts Heian era Kyoto. The duties of the Gotei 13 Divisions include defending allocated districts of Rukongai.

                        The living standards in Rukongai decline sharply beyond the fiftieth district, with an increase in people wearing rags and no footwear. According to statistics from the last 550 years, no Rukongai resident wears sandals beyond District 59. Rukongai is full of families that are not related by blood. People die at different times and places, and it is rare for a person to find their real family in the vast Rukongai.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        ### Schatten Bereich
                        German for Shadow Realm, after losing the war with the Shinigami 1,000 years ago, the Quincy escaped from the Human World into the Seireitei, the place they believed to be the most unguarded. In doing so, they used Reishi to create a demiplane in the "shadows". Their plan was to use the abundant Reishi that was only to be found in Soul Society as the source of their power, so they hid and waited for 1,000 years while gathering their power. This is what was called the Wandenreich, the "Invisible Empire".

                        Over 1,000 years ago, Yhwach had formed a Kingdom of Quincy named the Lichtreich (Empire of Light) which extended to all the nearby countries. In the 200 years since Yhwach's birth, the Lichtreich had conquered the nearby villages and lands.

                        #### Headquarters
                        The Wandenreich is currently based out of a building known as Silbern (Silver), known as the Silver Cross Castle, a large, ice-covered structure surrounded by a vast city roughly the size of the Seireitei. The Wandenreich uses metal plates, known as Gates of the Sun, to move around the large palace quickly. The headquarters is made purely out of Reishi particles from the Seireitei.

                        Silbern itself is a wide, two-tiered building. The bottom tier is supported by six thick columns, while the upper tier is roughly half as wide and long, instead being held up by pillars; it also features windows consisting of two thin slats in the wall on either side. The ground below it has a set of stairs leading up to the lower tier, and the entire complex is surrounded by an angular barrier with octagonal joints. Silbern is framed by two gutted, curving, tusk-like structures arching toward each other in front of it, and is dwarfed by a large, rectangular tower with a cross on each side rising up behind it.

                        #### Government
                        The Wandenreich is ruled by their emperor, previously Ywach, and is assisted by their advisor. The emperor chooses a crowned prince to replace them should they pass away or step down. The emperor has an elite group of quincy called the Sternritter (Star Knights), each as powerful, if not more powerful than a Captain from the Gotei 13 and led by the Sternritter Grandmaster. Several of these Sternritter that have proven to be the best serve as the emperors personal guard known as the Schutzstaffel. Then there is the Jagdarmee (Hunting Army) a hunting unit which, in the wake of Hueco Mundo's conquest by the Wandenreich, is entrusted with capturing Arrancar to serve the empire. Finally, there is the bulk of the army, the Soldat (Soldier) which can defeat low-ranked Shinigami with ease.

                        #### Military Attire
                        The typical attire of most Wandenreich personnel consists of a long, white, double-breasted trench coat with shoulder straps and a white, button-down bib. This coat is bound at the waist with a black belt, which is further adorned with a decorative buckle, and is worn over both white trousers and trench boots.

                        Many members sport white hats with black peaks and a crest emblazoned on its front, which is reminiscent of the five-pointed variant of the Quincy cross. This insignia is reflected by the buttons of their other apparel. Some higher-ranking members pair this uniform with other additional pieces of clothing, such as capes or cloaks, to distinguish themselves.[43] The Sternritter wear a distinctive white, ankle-length cloak over their uniform which features the Wandenreich insignia emblazoned on its back and often a hood attached to the cloak's collar. Apart from the standard uniform, a Soldat's attire consists of a military beret, black goggles with white lenses, a gas mask which obscures their entire face, and a short, collared cloak.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        ### The Royal Palace
                        The Royal Palace is a demiplane kept suspended above Soul Society that serves as the official residence of the Soul King and its Royal Guard. The Soul King Palace consists of several layers, with one layer suspended above the other. The lowest level is comprised from many buildings of the same style to that of Seireitei. From this, a large stairway leads upwards to a wide and flat expanse, with both areas at the base and top of these stairs being lined by rows of huge, circular pillars. This area is known as the Royal Palace Approach. Floating above are five discs, Known as the zero estates, with a town on each disc, each one ruled over by one of the Royal Guard members. Suspended higher still is a large cylindrical structure that has a conical top and bottom, this is the Royal Palace proper.

                        #### Entry
                        The route to the inner dimension in which the palace resides can only be opened with "a key", fittingly named the Ōken (Royal Key), the location of which is kept secret, only being passed down verbally from one Gotei 13 Captain-Commander to the next. There are only two ways to enter the Spirit King Palace:
                        1. With the permission of the Royal Guard. They don't have to be there physically, they only need to want the person to enter.
                        2. Using an Ōken.

                        A Royal Guard can also open up a Chōkaimon (Super World Gate) to send someone directly to the Human World, and use the same gate to send said "someone" back, but to do so requires syncing the arrival and departure times. when the Royal Guard do need to travel, their preferred method of transportation takes the form of a huge pillar called the Tenchūren (Heavenly-Pillar Palanquin). While this pillar is able to freely exit the demiplane, it is unable to return to the palace on its own and is instead entirely reliant on outside assistance to do so, such as Kūkaku Shiba's Kakaku Hō (Flower Crane Cannon).

                        #### Defenses
                        The sekkiseki walls that surround Seireitei are ordinarily intended to protect the Soul King Palace, instead meant only to fall down to Seireitei in times of emergency. However, if emergencies occur in succession, they remain in place around Seireitei indefinitely until things are returned to normal.

                        The Soul King Palace is further protected by 72 barriers between it and the Seireitei. Should these barriers be forced open via clothing constructed from an Ōken, they cannot be closed off for 1 hour and 40 minutes due to the sheer defensive power of the clothing.

                        There exist a group of elite guards known as "Divine Soldiers" which are led by Senjumaru Shutara, who refers to them as the "Blade of the Soul King". Each guard wears a black hakama with a purple sash tied around their waist and a black mask with four light-colored lines tracing over their heads, and their hair is tied into a long spike at the back of their head before being left to hang free about halfway through the length. They are all armed with swords.

                        There is a much more powerful version of these soldiers known as a "Second-Class Divine Soldier", which Senjumaru refers to as the "Shield of the Soul King". They resemble an ordinary soldier, but are extremely large and wear a circular black hat on their head. The backs of their wrists each have one-half of a large, black, circular shield on them.

                        #### The Royal City
                        The main Royal city is ran by the Royal Family. This sprawling city about the same size of Seireitei is shrouded in mystery. Only thing known of its denizens is that when a captain is promoted to the Royal Guard, they are allowed to bring their family with them as well.

                        #### The Zero Estates
                        Each Royal Guard member is awarded a town for them to oversee. The Royal Guard are free to shape and govern these towns however they wish. Some model it like any other town, others shape it for a single function and few make it so it's not uninhabited and use it for their own machinations.

                        ### Hell
                        Is an afterlife where Souls are sent if they were wicked when they were Human. For example, the Zanpakutō of a Shinigami can only cleanse Souls of the sins they committed as Hollows. If the spirit committed heinous crimes as a Human, it will be sent through the Gates of Hell instead of Soul Society.

                        The Gates of Hell are chained shut and adorned with the bandaged head and torso of a skeleton on each door. The arms of both skeletons are positioned at an angle to pull the gates open when it is summoned. On the inside, the Gates appear to be prevented from opening fully by two thick ropes with charms attached to them. The face and left arm of a large demonic creature can be seen behind the Gates. It has armor plating on its upper arm and it wields a blade. Its left arm and face are covered in tattoos resembling tribal markings. The demon skewers the souls entering Hell with its blade, and pulls it through the Gates, while laughing. The Gates then close and the entire structure cracks and crumbles into nothing.

                        Aside from being an afterlife for sinners, Hell's other primary function is to hold deceased captains of the Gotei 13, due to the Reishi comprising their bodies being too dense with Reiatsu to be reabsorbed by Soul Society and such powerful Reishi being too risky to allow to remain intact in the realm; this is accomplished by the performance of Konsō Reisai twelve years after a captain's death, though until the usage of this ceremony for Jūshirō Ukitake, the captains and lieutenants of the Gotei 13 had no idea it would result in their former comrades being cast into Hell. 

                        Similar to the balance of Souls between the Human World and Soul Society, Hell's integrity is maintained by a balance of Reiatsu between it and the combined realms of the Human World and Soul Society. When that balance is disrupted those within Hell can wrench open the gates and enter the Human World. During such an imbalance, performance of the Konsō Reisai is accompanied by the appearance of Jigoku no Rinki (Hellish Phosphoplasm), black blobs of a non-Reishi substance that float through the air of Soul Society around the grave of the deceased captain that the ceremony is being performed for as well as in the air of the Human World where a denizen of Hell has entered the realm; this substance is harmless when touched normally, but if a globule is cut in two by a Zanpakutō, its contents become acidic. Individuals who enter the Human World from Hell by taking advantage of this imbalance do so using a portal resembling a circular Garganta lined with teeth, though they can also be pulled back into Hell through the usual Gates.

                        #### Government
                        Hell has no known government or rulers, and is stated to fall outside of the jurisdiction of the Gotei 13..

                        #### Denizens
                        Those who have been cast down to Hell are transformed into Togabito (Sinners), they gain a white garb with thin black stripes and are bound by indestructible chains. Whilst in Hell, the Togabito are tormented in a constant cycle of rebirth, death and regeneration. Their tormentors being the Kushanāda.

                        The Kushanāda are the only known natural inhabitants of Hell, these gargantuan beings guard and punish the imprisoned Togabito for their crimes they committed while they were alive. They have elongated skull-like heads and a large piece of armor on their right shoulders. If they catch a Togabito, they will eat it, only for it to revive itself sometime later.

                        Hell uniquely affects any Arrancar cast into it after their death by moving their Hollow hole outside of their body and allowing them to gain new powers

                        Jigoku no Gaki (Beasts of Hell) are massive Hollows uniquely originating from Hell. While their appearances vary wildly, common visual motifs between them include large rings protruding from or comprising parts of their bodies and thick chain patterns on their skin. In addition to possessing great strength befitting their size, they do not emit any Reiatsu, allowing them to sneak up on even spiritually-aware Shinigami.

                        ### Hueco Mundo
                        Spanish for Hollow World, is the plane in which Hollows and Arrancar usually reside. It lies in between the Human World and Soul Society. Though it is separated from the bordering dimension known as the Dangai. It can be accessed by traversing the Garganta, a void between the worlds which can be crossed by Hollows, allowing them to travel to any other dimension at will.

                        An unchanging night covers the sky, an endless white desert covers the ground. The tree-like objects are not plants, but rather quartz-like minerals. The landscape of Hueco Mundo is a seemingly never-ending white desert, with a multitude of dunes, littered with boulders. In Hueco Mundo, the moon is on the opposite lunar phase of that in the Human World. The vast desert seems to lack any bodies of water and contains rocky formations. Like in Soul Society, the atmosphere is filled with a high concentration of Reishi, thus allowing smaller Hollows to gain nourishment despite the lack of Human souls.

                        Similar to the case of Human World deserts, active life in Hueco Mundo appears to be few and far between. Hollows generally dwell below the surface or in other areas until something provokes them to leave their shelter, like the intrusion of a foreign entity. All Hollows dwell in Hueco Mundo regardless of their shape, size, or power. When a hollow would be destroyed, and it wasn't slain by a Zanpakutō, or annihilated by Quincy's Heilig Bogen, they will reform in Hueco Mundo some time later.

                        #### Government
                        Hueco Mundo has an informal government, the strongest being wields power and is known as the King of Hueco Mundo. They reside within the palace known as Las Noches and controls the Espada and other "military" branches.

                        #### Las Noches
                        Spanish for "The Nights", is a massive fortress which can be seen for miles. It consists of a main building with a domed center surrounded by several large towers and smaller buildings. Atop the dome are five smaller towers, which appear to contain areas such as the King's throne room and the Espada meeting hall.

                        The Espada reside there with their army of Arrancar complete with medical facilities and detention wings. Las Noches is an exceedingly large structure, as large as the Seireitei in Soul Society, taking about three days to move from one area to a gate.

                        The inside of Las Noches' dome simulates the blue sky of the Human World. The position of the halls within the palace can also be adjusted, allowing the one operating them to direct the movements of intruders.

                        #### The Forest of Menos
                        is an area below the surface of Hueco Mundo's desert where the average Hollow hide from the Arrancar. The forest is filled with large trees made of a silvery quartz substance. These trees extend to the surface and dot the landscape of the desert in Hueco Mundo. Countless Gillian class Hollow live here and follow the commands of the Guardian of the Forest of Menos and his followers. The Adjuchas in charge of the Forest of Menos are under the command of the King.

                        #### Negal Ruins
                        These ancient ruins are all that remains of what Hueco Mundo used to be, before it became an endless desert. Not much is known and minimal efforts have been made to uncover more of the ruins and study them.

                        #### Laws
                        When operating underneath Sōsuke Aizen, certain laws were in place that were meant to be followed, the following laws were continued by the current King of Hueco Mundo:

                        * It is an offense to invade the World of the Living without permission.
                        * It is an offense for Espada members to mobilize their Fracción without authorization.
                        * It is an offense for Espada members to utilize the Exequias without authorization.
                        * It is forbidden for Espada ranked four and above from releasing their Zanpakutō within Las Noches.
                        * It is forbidden for any Espada to use a Gran Rey Cero inside Las Noches.

                        ### The Beast Realm
                        An afterlife of boundless wilderness, nature and fauna. When Humans or hollows commit heinous crimes, they're sent to Hell. However, when a Soul from Soul Society, or Schatten Bereich commit heinous crimes, they're reincarnated as a beast in the Beast Realm.

                        Those who have died and are reincarnated in the beast realm are referred to as Petitioners. When a petitioner is brought to the Beastlands, they take on the form of a beast that represents their crimes and live out as the animal as punishment. For example, if a murderer who preyed upon others would be sent here, they would take on the form of a mouse or rabbit, to be hunted upon. The petitioners have vague memories of their life before the Beastlands, mostly emotions around certain people, objects or creatures.

                        The Beast realm has a layer for every biome. Each layer has weather that is regionally distributed and provides all manner of conditions for the habitats of all creatures. Weather in one region doesn't affect adjacent regions, so an arid desert could exist next to a snowy winter region for example. These layers also interact and intersect other layers in various places as well.

                        #### Travel
                        Until recently, travel to the Beast realm was unknown and thought impossible. There were only two known methods, each closely guarded secrets. The first was a cave in the Soul Society guarded by the Werewolf clan, with the location only known by the Sajin clan. The second was a ritualistic hunt, where one would embark into the wilderness and attempt to hunt a powerful beast. At the end of the hunt when one would take the kill and prove successful, they'd find themselves in the beast realm. This ritual was guarded by the Shihōin clan.

                        However, after the imbalance from Hell, travel to the Beast realm through the Garganta was made possible. Currently the Gotei 13's 12th division is rigorously studying the Beast realm and on how it plays in part with the balance of souls.

                        Traveling across the plane is relatively straightforward and just requires you to walk to your destination. Walking between the layers of the Beast realm can happen erratically and when you least expect it. Ducking beneath a branch, you might find the tranquil forest replaced with the scorching heat of a desert. On the other hand, you might be being chased between two trees when all of a sudden you're catching yourself from falling off a cliff. These portals are common and it is quite easy to accidentally stumble upon them and make your way back to another layer.

                        #### Traits
                        This plane creates a hunger to eat, a yearning to hunt and to become more bestial in nature. This hunger is not a painful hunger, but rather a singular focus to fulfill the needs of hunting and to take part in eating a meal you hunted for. Though, visitors should be very careful because the beasts you hunt in the Beast realm may appear to be like the typical beasts in the Material Plane, but these beasts are cunning and intelligent. They can speak and form plans among other members of their packs, and they often end up becoming the hunter instead of the hunted.

                        The longer you stay in the Beast realm, the more likely that you will begin to start taking on the characteristics of beasts. A mighty warrior might begin growing tufts of fur like that of a bear, or a perceptive mage might grow the crooked beak of a hawk. These characteristics can be slow to take hold, those who value law are the slowest for these characteristics to start appearing, but they always do. For those closest to the wilderness, they take only a few hours while those who come from more civilized backgrounds might take a few days. These animal characteristics are only temporary and will disappear after a few days outside of the Beast realm.

                        #### Denizens
                        Most denizens are the petitioners and native inhabitants, taking on various bestial forms, the beastfolk and the Beast Lords. The beast folk are those who have survived long enough and through one way or another regained their humanity. They take on an anthropomorphic version of the beast they are, one such individual is the previous Captain Sajin Komamura. The Beast Lords are powerful creatures that are as powerful if not more powerful than Captains. They hunt across the plane, protecting their lands and provide direction and power in the chaotic wilderness

                        #### Government
                        The beast realm has no official government with every beast needing to defend themselves. However, each Beast lord has it's own clan. These "clans" are only official in name, with the bestial nature, these clans more closely resemble packs or prides that one would see in the wilderness in the Human realm.

                        #### Feature: All Eyes on You
                        Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, or  perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.

                        You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.

                        ## Artificial Souls
                        Translated from Gikon in Japanese, Artificial souls and the means to insert them into a body were created by Kirio Hikifune and her team of scientists. Before she came along, the thought of making artificial souls was a foreign one. She built upon the idea of Gikon and created the Gikongan (artificial pill). According to the core theory behind the artificial soul is to take the Reiatsu from one source and inject it into a different body, with the intention of turning the introduced power into that body's own. For this great achievement and contribution to Soul Society, Kirio was promoted to the Royal Guard.

                        Some time later more research was made into this technology. In an attempt to even the gap between Shinigami and Hollows, as Hollows generally outnumber Shinigami, project spearchead was initiated. This project seeked to create Modified Souls, more commonly referred to as Mod-Souls, are artificial souls designed to enhance regular Human physiology, making them capable of battling Hollows equally.

                        The Mod-Souls created varied in their abilities and can be defined by different types. For example, one Mod-Soul may be able to run many times faster than a regular Human while another may be many times stronger than normal. The Mod-Souls, just like regular artificial souls, are condensed into tiny, candy-like orbs. However, their originally intended purpose was to be placed into corpses to achieve their function as soldiers to combat Hollows. To fit with this purpose, they are also more independent than regular artificial souls.

                        The Mod-Souls were exterminated after the experiment was halted due to ethical reasons, since they were intended to be used to reanimate Human corpses to be used as weapons against Hollows. Most were exterminated, though few escaped, some were hidden, and few were mixed in with regular Gikongan.

                        Now the pills are mainly used by Shinigami when they're operating in the Human Realm when they have a gigai. By ingesting a Gikongan the pill forces the soul out of the body and allows the artificial soul to take control of it, operating in a pre-programmed manner until removed by the Shinigami. They can be used on a body which has no soul, such as a corpse, or even an inanimate object, such as a stuffed animal. These artificial souls possess their own personalities, which can be specially designed to fit one's specifications.

                        Currently, gikongan are commonly called Soul Candy, because the Shinigami Women's Association complained that its name was not cute and had it changed. To fit with the more informal name, Soul Candy is contained in toy dispensers, which have the heads of cartoon characters on them. These dispensers come in many varieties, with some being more popular than others. Artificial souls tend to have personalities which reflect traits of their corresponding dispenser's character.

                        ### Artificial Soul Traits
                        Your Artificial Soul character has the following traits.

                        **Soul Candy.** While not within a body, an artificial soul is a tiny pill with 10 Armor Class, 5 hit points, immune to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerable to bludgeoning damage.     
                        **Ability Score Increase.** As an artificial soul you were initially created to battle Hollows, as such your physical attributes were enhanced. Choose two different physical ability scores and one mental ability score, they each increase by 1.      
                        **Age.** Artificial souls have not been observed to have a maximum lifespan; they have not shown any signs of deterioration due to age.       
                        **Alignment.** Each Artificial Soul is designed with a specific alignment, though generally are lawful and/or neutral.        
                        **Size.** The artificial soul takes on the size of the body they inhabit, though it usually is Medium as that is the standard size of Gigai and Humans/Souls.        
                        **Speed.** While the artificial soul inhabits a body, its base walking speed becomes 40 feet.       
                        **Sentry's Rest.** When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.     
                        **Specialized Design.** You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.     
                        **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.     
                        **Spiritual Awareness.** Artificial Souls can see into and interact with the ethereal plane.        

                        \pagebreakNum

                        ## Humans
                        A living being who resides in the Human Realm. Most, if not all, beings who live in the Human World are Humans.

                        The majority of Humans are completely oblivious to the dangers they are exposed to from Hollow and other evil spirits. It is unknown how many Hollow attacks against Humans occur under normal circumstances, but Hollows make their former loved ones into their first victims before they begin preying on Pluses and Humans with spiritual powers. A severe enough attack from a Hollow, or a Shinigami, on a living Human would not only result in bodily harm, but in the removal of the Human's Soul from the body. The damage can be easily repaired through Kidō if the Chain of Fate is not broken.

                        Shinigami are forbidden by law from attacking Humans unless ordered to. They generally ignore Humans, but a part of their duties is protecting the Humans in jeopardy from Hollows. Some Shinigami have a tendency to view Humans as inferior, despite the majority of Souls, including most Shinigami, being of Human origins.

                        A very small percentage of the Human population develops a high amount of Spiritual Power; they are known as "High-Spec" Humans. These Humans can see and interact with Reishi-made objects, such as Souls, to varying degrees and for various reasons.

                        ### High-Spec Human
                        **Creature Type:** Humanoid     
                        **Size:** Medium (about 4-7 feet tall) or Small (about 2-4 feet tall), chosen when you select this race     
                        **Speed:** 30 feet      
                        **Life Span:** 90 years on average      
                        **Resourceful.** You gain Inspiration whenever you finish a long rest.      
                        **Skillful.** You gain Proficiency in one Skill of your choice.     
                        **Versatile.** You gain a Feat of your choice       
                        **Spiritual Awareness.** You can see into and interact with the ethereal plane.      

                        ### Human Lineages
                        The following are lineages you chan choose to be part of. You gain the lineages traits. A character might also gain a Lineage through a remarkable or tragic event. Work with your DM to establish if you’re amenable to such a development and how such stories unfold. Lineages marked with an asterisk (*) are suggested to not be chosen at character creation.

                        #### Soul
                        The spiritual beings that reside within Soul Society, and the spirits of dead Humans in the Human Realm are Souls. While many Souls are deceased Humans from the Human World, it is known that they can be born within Soul Society as well. There are a few different type of souls as described below.

                        Pluses are the benign souls in the Human World. They are the spirit of a person who has died. A chain, known as the Chain of Fate, protrudes from the chest and connects the soul to its living body. When this chain is severed, the soul can no longer return to its body and live.

                        The soul can move about freely if the chain is broken, but this also causes the chain to slowly corrode. Normally, pluses are sent to Soul Society by Shinigami in a ritual called Konsō before this corrosion becomes significant. If the Chain of Fate is corroded entirely, the Plus will become a Hollow.

                        Jibakurei (earch-bound spirit) are souls who are bound to a place and refuse to pass on. A Jibakurei is more vulnerable to a Hollow, as being bound to a certain area prevents them from fleeing as far as a normal Plus. This means that the Hollow would only need to search in a small area to find them. It can take months or even years for a Jibakurei to become a Hollow.

                        A Tsukirei (Possessive Spirit) is a soul very similar to a Jibakurei as it is also unable to leave the Human World because of something they regret leaving behind. The difference is that a Tsukirei is bound to a person, with the Chain of Fate being wrapped around said person.

                        A Blank is a soul with no memory that has become lost in the space between the Soul Society and the Human World, called the Valley of Screams.

                        A Soul would have the same statistics and traits as it did when it was alive.

                        **Augmented Spiritual Pressure.** You retain your creature type as Humanoid, yet you register as an Undead to spells and other effects that detect the presence of the Undead creature type.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Fullbringer
                        Fullbringers are spiritually-aware Humans born with the ability to manipulate the souls that reside in all physical matter. These powers originate from Hollow reiryoku. Like all spiritually aware Humans, Fullbringers can sense the Reiryoku of other spiritual beings, such as Hollows, Shinigami, and other Fullbringers. However, they differ in that they each have a parent who survived a Hollow attack before they were born. As a result, traces of the Hollows’ power remained in their parents bodies, which were then passed onto them at the moment of their birth. Therefore, their powers more closely resemble a Hollow’s than those of a Shinigami.

                        Their ability, called Fullbring, enables them to manipulate the souls contained within matter. Everything, even rudimentary objects such as lampposts and chairs possess a soul, however small. By using their power to “pull” on this soul, Fullbringers can manipulate the object's movement or even alter its physical characteristics. For example, Fullbringers could have a beverage assist them in drinking it by pulling on its soul, drawing it into their mouth. Likewise, by pulling on the soul of water, Fullbringers can walk across its surface without falling through. Many more feats are possible, making the technique highly versatile. Unlike other spiritual beings, Fullbringers use their power with their physical bodies. Because of this, they must train extensively to build up their stamina so they can use it properly. While all Fullbringers are born with this power, the age at which they come to realize it varies. When Fullbringers die, all traces of their abilities disappear from the world. However, they do carry their abilities into the afterlife.

                        **Ability Score Increase.** One ability score of your choice increases by 1.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Quincy
                        Japanese for Monk of Destruction, Quincy are spiritually aware Humans able to absorb and manipulate Spirit Particles into spiritual weapons. The Quincy were a clan scattered all over the world dedicated to fighting Hollows. It is currently unknown when the Quincy first came into being. Some state that Yhwach began the Quincy and his blood flows in every Quincy. However, according to the Quincy themselves, there were Quincy before Yhwach.

                        While they are trained to confront Hollows in order to defeat them just as Shinigami do, the biggest difference between the Quincy and Shinigami, since ancient times, is whether or not to kill Hollows. The Shinigami purify Hollows with their Zanpakutō and send them to Soul Society, while the Quincy killed the Hollows. The idea can be seen as comparing justice and vengeance: "Hollows devour souls of Humans, so why must it be that those who harm and kill friends and relatives get sent peacefully to Soul Society?" Captain Mayuri Kurotsuchi surmises Quincy are not hostile to Hollows because of a difference in ideology, because Hollow have no ideology, and theorizes there is only one reason for them to maintain such a grudge for so long: the Quincy fear the Hollows who endanger their lives. This view is corroborated by Kisuke Urahara, who reveals that Quincy have no "anti-bodies" to defend from Hollows; Hollows are poisonous to Quincy. If a Quincy is infected by a Hollow, not only does their Reiryoku weaken leading to death, but their soul itself is destroyed; they cannot even undergo Hollowfication like a Shinigami. This is why Quincy must eradicate Hollows.

                        Shinigami govern the souls between the Human World and Soul Society, which maintains a balance that if not kept would result in the mutual destruction of both worlds. All souls, including Hollows, are subject to the Shinigami governance of maintaining the balance. Quincy completely extinguish Hollows, thus the souls that come to the Human World do not return to Soul Society and therefore the souls would increase only on the side of the Human World. As a result, the Human World becomes heavy in souls, causing Soul Society to spill over into it, mixing life and death together.

                        With the potential destruction of both worlds, Soul Society tried to appeal to the Quincy that the handling of Hollows should be left to the Shinigami. The Quincy refused to accept the situation. As time went on, the number of Quincy increased and the cycle of souls became more unstable, forcing the Shinigami to reluctantly wipe out the Quincy in order to maintain the balance of the world. Few escaped into the Schatten Bereich and some into the other realms, primarily the Human realm.

                        The Quincy line was closely monitored over the decades, as their numbers continued to dwindle. Later the Quincy advanced the idea that since they were already among the living and still more numerous at the time, they could act as "first responders" to Hollow attacks: protecting Humans until the less-numerous Shinigami could send a representative to finish the Hollow off. Embittered by the recent war, the Shinigami refused to participate, opting instead to allocate their limited resources to reacting to the most dangerous Hollows and current Hollow attacks.

                        **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.      
                        **Hollow vulnerability.** Hollow attacks, abilities and spells deals an additional 2d6 damage to you.       
                        **Acute Reiatsu Perception.** You have advantage on reiatsu checks.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Visored*
                        The Visored are a group of Shinigami that have acquired Hollow powers through experimentation, usually not of their own free will. When a Hollow is inserted into the soul of a Shinigami it merges with them and their Zanpakutō. This process is very dangerous as the Shinigami must battle this Hollow within them. Losing this battle results in the Hollow taking of their body, however if the Shinigami wins they gain the ability to don a Hollow mask, and have access to Hollow powers. This process is known as Hollowfication.

                        The Visored appear entirely Human and, barring when they use their powers, are indistinguishable from ordinary Shinigami. To gain access to their Hollow powers, a Visored dons a Hollow mask. Their spiritual pressure likewise changes into a mix of  Hollow and Shinigami.

                        The transition from a Shinigami into a Visored is usually met with swift exile from Soul Society. The Visored and any other parties involved will be considered criminals by the Soul Society for breaking the law of acquiring Hollow powers. Their status or rank of any kind are stripped and if apprehended would spend the rest of their days in the deepest level of the Central Great Underground Prison.

                        ### Supernatural Gift: Visored

                        The Dungeon Master has the option to allow a character created in a Bleach campaign to be Visored. Alternatively, a character who undergoes Hollowfication in the course of a campaign might become a Visored.

                        Becoming a Visored is a supernatural gift (see "Supernatural Gifts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) that bestows upon you the following traits.

                        **Inner Battle.** To first gain access to the the rest of the traits you must first defeat the Hollow merging with your soul. 

                        You must spend 1 minute meditating to enter your Inner World. Once their you immediately battle the Hollow. You have access to all your armament and abilities as you normally would, but no other equipment. The Hollow takes on the appearance of you, but a dark, twisted and evil version. It uses the same statistics as your character but with the Hollow template applied.

                        While battling with your Hollow, your actual body starts to spill white material from its eyes and mouth and transforming into a Hollow and goes on a rampage attacking anyone in sight trying to devour any souls. For each soul your Hollow possessed body devours, it gains a cumulative +1 bonus on all ability checks, skill checks and damage rolls within the Inner Battle.

                        If you would lose the Inner Battle, you are slain, the Hollow takes over your body and transforms into an Arrancar and is controlled by the DM. If your actual body would be slain, you are slain as well.

                        However, if you would defeat the Hollow, you emerge victorious, donning your Hollow mask. You gain four Hollow abilities.

                        **Hollow Mask.** On your turn, as a bonus action you don your Hollow mask, gaining the following benefits.

                        * You gain access to your Hollow abilities.
                        * All forms of movement you have are increased by 20 feet.
                        * You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
                        * You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources.

                        Your mask lasts for 1 minute increments, for a total number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus. You may dismiss your mask at will and you regain all expended minutes on a long rest.

                        Whenever you would gain a level, you gain a Hollow ability (your level = your HD amount) or an armament ability. Starting at level 10, your HD is increased by your proficiency bonus for the purposes of fulfilling HD prerequisites for Hollow abilities.

                        **Augmented Spiritual Pressure.** You retain your creature type, yet you register as a Hollow to spells and other effects that detect the presence of the Hollow creature type.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        ## Hollow
                        Are former Pluses who lose their hearts to despair or regret, or they remain in the Human World for too long. These corrupt spirits with supernatural powers devour the souls of both living and deceased Humans. Hollows settle in Hueco Mundo, but can traverse the Garganta into the Human World, Soul Society and other realms.

                        The majority of souls peacefully move on to the Soul Society after their death. However, some stay in the living world to fulfill certain goals, such as looking after a loved one, protecting a particular location, or pursuing a grudge from beyond the grave. However, with only limited abilities to interact with the living, and by definition tied to their goals, many souls find they are unable to cope when their loved ones move on or old enemies forget them. At this point, some will become dangerously obsessed with fulfilling those goals, even if the means to fulfill them renders the soul empty: for example, killing anyone who comes near a loved one in order to keep them from hurting that person. In doing so, the ghost warps into a Hollow and, ironically, often makes the focus of their obsession into their first victim.

                        The process by which a soul becomes a Hollow is reflected by the length of the soul's Chain of Fate, which usually resides in the center of their chest, and connects to their bodies, if present. The Chain of Fate slowly corrodes over time, coinciding with the degradation of the soul's ties to the living world. The process can be accelerated under certain conditions, such as being attacked by a Hollow, giving into extreme despair, or using certain spiritual powers. When the chain completely decays, they become a Hollow when a hole opens up on their chest where the chain was attached, signifying they have lost their heart.

                        Once a soul becomes a Hollow, it is driven by an eternal and insatiable hunger to devour other souls, living or dead, to fill the void caused by its descent. Hollows are usually mindless creatures concerned only with finding the most potent souls to devour. Stronger and more evil Hollows are often able to retain some of their intelligence in Hollow form, making them more dangerous than the average Hollow. 

                        All Hollows wear masks, which are formed from the hearts they had lost as Humans. This mask protects the naked instinct which is left in a being after the loss of its heart, and obscures the original identity of the Hollow. The masks of different Hollows can differ greatly in shape and form, but are always white and skull-like. The mask can be shattered, temporarily allowing the Hollow to regain its original identity, but it will regenerate after a short period once the Hollow takes over again. When a Hollow's heart is carved out by the hole in their chests, the lost heart becomes its mask. The powers a Hollow wields are manifestations of its heart.

                        When a Hollow is slain by a Shinigami's Zanpakutō, the Hollow is not truly killed; its spirit is purified of the sins it committed as a Hollow. This allows the spirit within to enter the Soul Society as a Plus. In cases where a Hollow committed great sins as a mortal, its purification will summon the gates of Hell, through which the soul is dragged to its punishment. When a Hollow is killed by a Quincy, it is destroyed, soul and all. When dispatched by other spiritual powers, the Hollow will reform back in Hueco Mundo some time later.

                        ### Menos Classification
                        Though most Hollows are simply transformed Human souls, a sub-group of Hollows known as Menos Grande, or simply Menos, exist. Menos are created when the void within an ordinary Hollow's heart becomes so substantial Human souls are incapable of sustaining it, at which point it begins devouring fellow Hollows. These cannibal Hollows are attracted to one another, and a mass inter-devouring follows, resulting in a Gillian. This is the first of the three categories of Menos, the three being: Gillian, Adjuchas and Vasto Lorde.

                        Menos evolution is not only contingent upon the Menos eating other Hollows, but also upon the Menos' ability to avoid being eaten. If another Hollow succeeds in devouring even a part of their body, evolution becomes impossible for the one who was wounded this way. Menos-class Hollows are considered so dangerous Soul Society sends only highly trained Shinigami teams to handle them.

                        #### Gillian
                        Are the first and weakest of all Menos. There are many of them, and they all look alike. In Soul Society, they are the "Menos" who are generally referred to in textbooks. Gillians are huge, but they are slow and have beast-like intellect that commonly attack in a group. 

                        Gillians are gargantuan Hollows at least 2-6 stories tall, easily dwarfing even the largest standard Hollow. They all have a white mask with an elongated nose. Their bodies are covered from their head to their feet with a black covering reminiscent of a cloak. Around their neck is a row of thin white spikes. They have large, pointed feet wrapped in white bandages. They have large white hands with long, sharp, white nails, but they are commonly hidden within their cloak, rarely revealed even in combat. They have long tongues capable of breaking a fellow Hollow's mask.

                        Though Gillians usually have no personality to speak of, which makes them dangerous since they have no mind of their own, one of the many Hollows which comprise it might gain control over the newly formed entity, reflected in the unique mask it wears in comparison to a normal Gillian. Only these Gillian variants have the potential to evolve into Adjuchas-class Menos. The evolution is facilitated by the continued cannibalization of fellow Hollows, even other Gillians.

                        #### Adjuchas
                        Are the second classification of Menos. They are smaller than Gillians as they get more powerful they're able to more precisely control their reiryoku. They are much smarter and stronger than Gillians, and are often the ones who lead Gillians into battle. Adjuchas are commonly solitary creatures, rarely joining into groups. Adjuchas can vary radically in appearance, anywhere from bulky humanoids to beast-like characteristics.

                        Adjuchas-class Menos are much smaller in population compared to the Gillian class, due to the rarity of any one Hollow being capable of overwhelming the many other Hollows which comprise the body of a Gillian. Furthermore, the Adjuchas must continue to devour Hollows, or its mind will be absorbed by the other Hollows comprising its form, and it will revert into a Gillian. The subsequent lack of an individual will prevent the reverted Gillian from becoming an Adjuchas again.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Vasto Lorde
                        Are the third classification of Menos. They are extremely rare in number, and it is said that their entire number within Hueco Mundo can be counted with the fingers on one's hands. The combat capabilities of a Vasto Lorde are said to be above those of the captains of the Gotei 13.

                        The process for the creation of a Vasto Lorde is not fully understood. An adjuchas can devour over three thousand hollows and still not evolve into a Vasto Lorde. Some hollow speculate that a Vasto Lorde is determined upon an individual's birth as a Hollow, or perhaps before that. The only known method to become a Vasto Lorde is for an Adjuchas to devour the souls of powerful non-hollows, such as a vice captain.

                        #### Arrancar
                        Is a powerful hollow that has removed its mask, gaining Shinigami-like powers. A Menos usually takes on a Human shape when it becomes an Arrancar. The only ones that will definitely get a 100% Humanoid form are Vasto Lorde-class Menos. For the remaining two levels, there are many who don't get a completely Humanoid form, despite becoming Arrancar. Therefore, the closer one looks to a Hollow, the lower its power of reasoning. There have been Arrancar who have claimed that they gave up their Humanoid forms in order to obtain enormous power.

                        All Arrancar retain a hole in them somewhere, as well as fragments of their Hollow mask known as an estigma. A number of Arrancar have tried to conceal the remnants of their past whilst others choose to hide their faces completely to escape unwanted attention. Most also have a colored marking of some sort on their face, although some only gain these markings upon the release of their Zanpakutō.

                        The Arrancar seal their abilities within the form of a sword. It is entirely different from what Shinigami use. When they release their Zanpakutō's seal, they unleash their true power and their true form. Therefore, an Arrancar's release of their Zanpakutō is merely a temporary restoration to their former selves, granting them any powers their Hollow form possesses. The act of release is called Resurrección (Spanish for "Resurrection"), which is activated with a command phrase followed by the name of the sword.

                        When a creature becomes a Hollow, apply the following template to it:

                        **Creature Type.** The creature gains the (Hollow) creature type tag.

                        **Hole & Mask.** The creatures chain of fate corroded away leaving behind a hole signifying their heart fading away, and becoming their Hollow mask.

                        **Spell Point Pool.** The hollow gains a pool of Spell Points equal to their HD total plus their proficiency bonus. They regain any spent SP on a long rest.

                        **Ability Score Increase.** One ability score is increased by 2, or two ability scores are increased by 1.

                        **Damage Resistances.** The Hollow has resistance to Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

                        **Darkvision.** The Hollow can see in dim light within 60 feet of it as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. It can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

                        **Hollow Evolution.** The Hollow must eat souls for sustenance. At a minimum, it must eat a number of souls equal to their HD per week.

                        When it eats a soul with HD equal to or greater than its own, its HD amount permanently increases by one and gains a Hollow ability.

                        **Slam.** If the Hollow has no attacks, it gains the Slam natural melee weapon attack. It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

                        **Kūmon.** The Hollow gains the Kūmon ability, regardless if the requirements are met or not. 

                        **Unique Abilities.** The Hollow gains a number of Hollow abilities equal to its HD plus one.

                        > ##### NPC Hollow abilities
                        > DMs, feel free to adjust, modify, or ignore the Hollow Evolution feature as you see fit. Give the Hollow NPC more or less HD and Hollow abilities as needed. Most of the time Hollows will be evolving and getting stronger Off-Screen.

                        ### Hollow Progression
                        When a Hollow reaches the next stage in it's evolution by acquiring the specified number of HD listed on the "Hollow HD Progression Table" it gains the following features or Hollow abilities (whether the prerequisites are met or not) based on which evolution stage it reached.

                        **Gillian.** Base size changed to colossus (any hollow abilities affecting size can be replaced), Cero, Kūmon, Negación, and Swallow Whole. Alternatively you can use the Gillian statblock listed in Chapter 8: Friends & Foes.

                        **Adjuchas.** Base size changed to your choice between Huge or Medium (any abilities related to size can be replaced), Intelligence and Wisdom increased by 2, Negación ability is replaced with any other Hollow ability, and Sonído.

                        **Vasto Lorde.** Base size changes to Medium (any abilities related to size can be replaced) and four Hollow abilities.

                        ### Hollow Player Characters
                        To build a Hollow PC, it is recommended to start as an Adjuchas. To do so you first choose a Non-humanoid creature from the Monster Manual with a CR 3 or less (or another creature approved by your DM) and apply the PC Hollow template to it. You may choose monsters from a different source and/or from a higher CR if allowed by your DM.

                        #### Hollow PC Template

                        **Creature Type.** The creature gains the (Hollow) creature type tag.

                        **Hole & Mask.** Your chain of fate corroded away leaving behind a hole signifying your heart fading away, and becoming your Hollow mask. 

                        **Hit Die Increase.** If your HD amount is less than 10, you gain a number of HD equal to the difference. To increase your HP total you can either roll the HD dice, or take the average.

                        **Spell Point Pool.** You gain a pool of Spell Points equal to your HD total plus your proficiency bonus. You regain any spent SP on a long rest.

                        **Ability Score Increase.** You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

                        **Damage Resistances.** You have resistance to Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

                        **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

                        **Hollow Evolution.** You must eat souls for sustenance. At a minimum, you must eat a number of souls equal to your HD per week.

                        When you eat a soul with HD equal to or greater than your own, your HD amount permanently increases by one and you gain 1 Hollow point. These points stay with you until they are spent.

                        Each time your HD permanently increases from this feature, you can spend any number of Hollow points to gain that many Hollow abilities.

                        **Slam.** If you have no attacks, you gain the Slam natural melee weapon attack. It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

                        **Kūmon.** You gain the Kūmon ability, regardless if the requirements are met or not. 

                        **Unique Abilities.** You gain a number of Hollow abilities equal to half your HD plus three. You can forgo any number of these hollow abilities and gain that many Hollow points.

                        This section includes the two new classes, Shinigami and Quincy.

                        <div class="mini-chapter-1">## Shinigami</div>
                        
                        A group of Shinigami are ambushed by an Espada and it's Fraccion. Akihiko engages the Espada, both clash swords and trade swings back and forth, a brilliant display of steel and skill.

                        Izuna releases here Shikai, her sword manifesting into a set of heavy armor and surprises one of the Fraccion member with heavy blows, showing off her hand-to-hand expertise.

                        Akatsuya keeps the final Fraccion member at bay with Shunpo clones and fast attacks, dashing in and out of range, overwhelming her opponent with deadly speed.

                        Ikuto stands in the back casting Kidō. He casts Bakudō #9 Hōrin to stop the advance of a fraccion giving Izuna an opening, he follows that up with Kaido #26 Enlarge to grow Akihiko twice his size, finally after Akatsuya distracts her opponent and gives Ikuto enought time, he finishes off the fraccion member with Hadō #33 Sōkatsui and reduces it to dust.

                        All of these heroes are Shinigami, specialized in one type of combat learned from the academy.

                        ### Duties
                        As a Shinigami you are the guardian of souls, protecting them from Hollows, souls that have been corrupted. These Hollow devour souls and disrupt the balance of reincarnation between Soul Society and the Living Realm. By slaying Hollows with your Zanpakutō, you purify them and send them off into the afterlife, back into the reincarnation cycle.

                        ### Shin'ō Academy
                        As a Shinigami you're a graduate of the Shinōreijutsuin (Spiritual Arts Academy), or more commonly known as the Shinigami Academy. Through their six year curriculum you learned all four major Shinigami combat forms: Hakuda, Hohō, Kidō and Zanjutsu.

                        During this time you excelled and specialized in one of these combat forms.

                        ### Creating a Shinigami
                        As you build your Shinigami, think about two related elements of your character's background: Which combat form will you specialize in? When and how did you discover your high reiryoku? What motivated you to join the academy and become a Shinigami?

                        ## Class Features
                        As a Shinigami, you gain the following class features

                        </div>

                        ### Spellcasting
                        After completing your training at the academy you have learned to manipulate spirit particles to create devastating effects. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter X of this book for the Shinigami spell list.

                        #### Cantrips
                        At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Shinigami spell list. 

                        #### Spell Points
                        The Shinigami table shows how many spell points you have to cast spells at each level. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so. 

                        To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

                        For example, to create a spell slot of 1st level, you would need to expend two spell points.

                        Spells of 3rd level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. Once per long rest, you can create one spell slot of each level of 3rd or higher a number of times, equal to half your proficiency modifier, rounded down.

                        #### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
                        At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Shinigami spell list.

                        Each time you gain a Shinigami level, you can learn one new spell of your choice for free. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Max Spell Level column for your level. 
                        Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Shinigami spell list, which also must be no higher than what's shown in the table's Max Spell Level column for your level.

                        #### Spellcasting Ability
                        Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Kidō. You can use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for Kidō you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                        </font>

                        ### Unarmored Defense
                        While you are not wearing any armor or using a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Proficiency bonus.

                        ### Hakuda
                        Japanese for Hand-to-Hand Combat, Hakuda is a close combat style of fighting, in which one is unarmed and uses only one's body.

                        You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. This die increases as you gain levels, as shown in the Hakuda column of the Shinigami table.

                        ### Shunpo
                        Japanese for Flash Step, Shunpo is a special type of movement technique which allows the user to move faster than the eye can follow.

                        When you would use your normal movement, you can instead use Shunpo. You expend a number of Shunpo feet in increments of 5 feet to teleport that same amount to an unoccupied space you can see. You regain expended Shunpo on a short or long rest. Your Shunpo distance increases as you gain levels, as shown in the Shunpo column.

                        ### Zanpakutō

                        Japanese for Soul Slayer, a Zanpakutō is the main weapon of the Shinigami. The art of weilding one is called Zanjutsu; Japanese for Swordsmanship.

                        When students are accepted into the academy they are given an Asauchi (Shallow Hit). These are nameless Zanpakutō in which the Shinigami has not yet connected too and have no "identity." Over time while the Shinigami wields this weapon, they slowly pour their Spiritual Power into the weapon.

                        In doing so the Zanpakutō develops it's own independent personality. This spirit is a reflection of the owner's soul, as well as it's shape and abilities. Once a Shinigami learns their Zanpakutō's name and release command, they can communicate with one another and grow stronger together. 

                        #### Ability Score Improvement
                        When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1.

                        Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

                        \columnbreak

                        ### Extra Attack
                        Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

                        ### Indomitable
                        Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

                        You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.

                        ### Enhanced Durability
                        Beginning at 13th level, when you are reduced to 0 HP and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

                        ### Timeless Body
                        Starting at 17th level, your Spiritual Power causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Quincy spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                        ## Arrancar
                        Spanish for "tear off", these group of Hollows gained similar powers to Shinigami by removing their masks. The ritual needed for a Hollow to remove their mask and gain these powers is not fully known.

                        Arrancar are assigned a number from numbers 11 and above indicating the order of their birth.

                        ### Creating a 1st level Arrancar
                        These steps are only if you don't have a pre-existing hollow and you have your GM's permission to create an Arrancar.

                        First, choose a Beast from the Monster Manual (approved by your GM) as your base (any damage immunities, condition immunities, features, and actions are sealed). 

                        Second, apply the Hollow PC template to that creature.

                        Third, if your HD is below 15, you gain a number of HD equal to the difference.

                        Fourth, your creature type is changed to Humanoid, you become bipedal and your size becomes Medium. If your base has additional appendages and legs, those are sealed as well.

                        Finally, pick a Hollow background (wip) and your done.

                        > ##### How strong are Arrancar?
                        > Currently, a 1st level Arrancar should be slightly stronger than an 8th level Shinigami. It is recommended to not have a 1st level party include an Arrancar, unless they're all Arrancar.


                        ### Arrancar Physiology
                        Arrancar not only share similar powers to the Shinigami, but their anatomy as well. When a menos becomes an Arrancar it usually takes on a Human shape. This is defintely true when a Vasto-Lorde class Menos becomes an Arrancar.

                        **Estigma.** Each hollow has a pattern on their face that is unique to them. These tattoo like markings are the remaining part of their mask. Example, Ulquiorra Cifer has tear like markings on his face. Some might only appear during Resurrección.      

                        **Hollow Hole.** The most distinctive characteristic of a Hollow is the hole in their body. It represents the lack of a heart that is difficult to fill. This can be located on almost any area of a Hollow's body.         

                        **Mask Fragment.** Finally, the Hollow has some remnant of their mask that they tore off, somewhere on their head.

                        **Zanpakutō.** An arrancar's Zanpakutō is entirely different from what Shinigami use. A Hollow's true power and their true form is sealed within their Zanpakutō. Therefore, when they release, it is a temporary restoration to their former selves, granting them any powers their Hollow form has.

                        ## Fullbringer
                        Are spiritually-aware Humans born with the eponymous ability Fullbring, which allows them to manipulate the souls that reside in all physical matter. Their powers are constituted by Hollow Reiryoku

                        ### Fullbring
                        This ability enables them to manipulate the souls contained within matter. Everything, even rudimentary objects such as lampposts and chairs possess a soul, however small. By using their power to “pull” on this soul, Fullbringers can manipulate the object's movement or even alter its physical characteristics. For example, by pulling on the soul of water, Fullbringers can walk across its surface without falling through. Many more feats are possible, making the technique highly versatile. Unlike other spiritual beings, Fullbringers use their power with their physical bodies. Because of this, they must train extensively to build up their stamina so they can use it properly. While all Fullbringers are born with this power, the age at which they come to realize it varies. When Fullbringers die, all traces of their abilities disappear from the world. However, they do carry their abilities into the afterlife.

                        ### Creating a Fullbringer
                        As you build your Fullbringer, think about character’s background in regards to your Fullbringer powers: When did your powers manifest? Did this cause any problems? Where your parents also Fullbringers? Did you train alone or did another Fullbringer help you?

                        Starting at 1st level, your training allows you to harness your reiryoku. This is represented by a number of Spell Points. Your Fullbringer level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Spell Points column.

                        ### Object Afinnity
                        By developing an affinity for a particular object, a Fullbringer can alter its form, granting powers that vary greatly among individuals. This affinity can be defined by one’s love for the object in question, or simply by an overall fondness for it. As such, this power is usually awakened through a strong emotion associated with the object. Using this affinity, Fullbringers pull out the object’s soul and boost it with their own, transforming it in the process.

                        Choose a mundane non-weapon object to be your sealed armament.

                        **Cross (1 SP)** On a hit roll 1d4, you deal extra bludgeoning damage equal to the result and regain the same amount of SP.

                        Starting at 6th level you lose the Extra Attack feature if you have it and cannot gain that feature.

                        On your turn, if you use the Attack action with a Martial Technique and succeed, you can spend 2 SP to begin a Combination. You make an additional Martial Technique, if successful you repeat this process until you do not succeed on an attack roll, which ends the Combination.

                        #### Iron Fist
                        Beginning at 10th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

                        #### Critical Blows
                        Starting at 14th level, your unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

                        #### Expanded Technique
                        At 18th level, the following spells and armament abilities are added to the list of Martial Techniques you can choose from:

                        Spirit Blast, Primal Savagery, Shocking Grasp, and Inflict Wounds.

                        * You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws
                        * Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
                        * You can Hide as a bonus action.

                        #### Sneak Attack
                        Begining at 2nd level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

                        You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

                        The amount of the extra damage increases by an additional 1d6 at 6th, 10th, 14th and 18th level to a total of 5d6.

                        #### Evasion
                        Starting at 6th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a Hollows Cero. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

                        #### Supreme Sneak
                        At 10th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

                        #### Blindsense
                        At 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

                        #### Death Attack
                        At 18th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.

                        ### Berserker
                        By pulling on your soul you can enter trance of rage and fury.

                        #### Berserk
                        Beginning at 2nd level, on your turn, you can spend 2 SP and enter Berserk mode as a bonus action.

                        While beserking, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing armor:

                        * You have advantage on checks and saving throws involving Strength or Constitution
                        * If you used the Attack action to make a Melee weapon attack, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action
                        * You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage
                        * If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while berserking

                        Your Berserk mode lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end it on your turn as a bonus action.

                        Once you have berserked, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

                        #### Unarmored Defense
                        Starting from 2nd level, while you are not wearing any armor or wielding a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. 

                        #### Mindless Rage
                        At 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while berserking. If you are charmed or frightened when you berserk, the effect is suspended for the duration. 

                        #### Relentless
                        At 10th level, berserking can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re berserking and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

                        Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

                        #### Retaliation
                        Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

                        #### Primal Champion
                        At 18th level, your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

                        ### Pyschomancer
                        Your Fullbring abilities allow you to physically manipulate the souls of matter to move them at your will.

                        You gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws.

                        #### Psychokinesis 
                        Starting at 2nd level, you can cast the Catapult spell and Mage Hand spell at will.

Additionally, the Mage Hand can carry an additional 5 pounds per your Intelligence modifier.

                        You learn spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Telekinetic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a Fullbringer spell for you.

                        ##### Telekinetic Spells
                        | Fullbringer Level | Spells |
                        |:-------:|:-----:|

                        **Spellcasting Ability**    
                        Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Fullbringer spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                        Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

                        Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

                        **Spellcasting Focus**  
                        You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your Fullbringer spells.

                        #### Telekinesis
                        At 6th level, you can cast the telekinesis spell at will and without verbal or somatic components.

                        #### Telekinetic Defense
                        At 10th level, you can cast any of your telekinetic spells, that don't deal damage, as a Reaction when you are targeted by a spell or attack.

                        #### Telekinetic Flight
                        At 14th level, you gain a Fly speed equal to your walking speed.

                        #### Telekinetic Singularity
                        At 18th level, as an action you can spend 10 SP to create a  20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force at a point you can see within 60 feet and tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d12 force damage and is pulled in a straight line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pulled.

                        ### Infusionist
                        Through your fullbring, souls of other objects have spoken to you. Allowing you the ability to tinker with items.

                        #### Spellcasting
                        Through intense training you are able to manipulate your Reiryoku to produce spells. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the Human spell list.

                        ##### Cantrips
                        At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Human spell list. 

                        ##### Spell Points
                        Your Fullbringer level determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so. 

                        To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

                        For example, to create a spell slot of 1st level, you would need to expend two spell points.

                        Spells of 3rd level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. Once per long rest, you can create one spell slot of each level of 3rd or higher a number of times, equal to half your proficiency modifier, rounded down.

                        ##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
                        At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Human spell list.

                        Each time you gain a Fullbringer level, you can learn one new spell of your choice for free. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Max Spell Level column for your level. 
                        Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Human spell list, which also must be no higher than what's shown in the table's Max Spell Level column for your level.

                        ##### Spellcasting Ability
                        Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your magic. You can use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

                        In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for spells you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                        #### Infusions
                        At 2nd level, you pull on the soul of mundane items and mix in a part of your soul, infusing them with magic. You learn four infusions. You learn two new ones at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

                        After performing a ritual that takes 1 minute and spending the listed amount of SP, you touch a non-magical item and imbue it with one of your infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “Attunement” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

                        Your infusion remains in an item until you finish your next long rest, after that the infusion vanishes.

                        You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at a time; the maximum number of objects is equal to your profiency bonus + 1. Each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.

                        #### Infusions List

                        At 6th level you can pull on the soul of an object you hold or your immediate surroundings to gain visions of its past. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a spell.

                        Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

                        **Object Reading.** Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object’s previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.

                        **Area Reading.** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

                        #### Infuse Magic Item
                        Starting at 10th level you can also use your Infusions feature on magic items.

                        #### Dual Infusions
                        Beginning at 14th level, you can infuse two infusions on a single item. They must be two different infusions.

                        #### Eternal Infusions

                        ### Templar

                        You gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws.

                        #### Spellcasting
                        Through intense training you are able to manipulate your Reiryoku to produce spells. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the Human spell list.

                        ##### Cantrips
                        At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Human spell list. 

                        ##### Spell Points
                        Your Fullbringer level determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so. 

                        To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

                        For example, to create a spell slot of 1st level, you would need to expend two spell points.

                        Spells of 3rd level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. Once per long rest, you can create one spell slot of each level of 3rd or higher a number of times, equal to half your proficiency modifier, rounded down.

                        ##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
                        At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Human spell list.

                        Each time you gain a Fullbringer level, you can learn one new spell of your choice for free. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Max Spell Level column for your level. 
                        Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Human spell list, which also must be no higher than what's shown in the table's Max Spell Level column for your level.

                        ##### Spellcasting Ability

                        In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for Kidō you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                    #### Konsō
                    Soul Burial is the process by which Shinigami send Pluses to Soul Society from the Human World, which is known as "crossing over". To achieve this, they tap the hilt of their Zanpakutō against a Plus's forehead, leaving an emblem at the point of impact which begins to shine brightly. The Plus proceeds to sink into the ground in a pool of blue light as they are sent to Soul Society, and a hell butterfly flies away from their point of departure.
                    
                    As an action you make a melee attack on a Plus. To resist the Konsō's effect if must make a Constitution saving throw, DC 10 + your level.
                    A Plus is willing and automatically fails it's saving throw if you've completed it's Quest.
                    
                    #### Sublimation
                    When a Hollow is slain with a Zanpakutō, it is cleansed of the sins it committed as a Hollow, and passes into the afterlife. This is called sublimation.
                    
                    Souls who pass into Soul Society will be reborn again into the Human World once their "life" in Soul Society comes to an end. However, if the Hollow committed heinous crimes, it will be sent through the Gates of Hell instead of Soul Society.

                    #### Kengen
                    Your Zanpakutō has developed it's own personality. Your Zanpakutō takes on a more unique appearance. It's scabbard, tsuba, handle or other aesthetics have changed. You learn the name of your Zanpakutō and obtain it's initial release form, also known as Shikai. You gain two armament abilities.
                    
                    You don't simply pick a name, for the living spirit of the Zanpakutō already has its own name. The Shinigami must be able to communicate and harmonize with their Zanpakutō effectively, which requires being able to speak to the spirit within its world. Gaining access to one's Shikai and releasing it for the first time is known as Kengen (Manifestation).
                    
                    To activate this form you must chant a Kaigo (Release Call). Using the Kaigo, followed by the name of the Zanpakutō, activates Shikai. It is crucial to memorize each phrase, as every Zanpakutō has a different Kaigo.
                    
                    As an action you spend 1 SP to activate Shikai. This form lasts for a number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus, which you can dismiss as an action.
                    
                    If your Shikai would be broken or destroyed, as long as their is some part of it remaining, you may restore it. Your Zanpakutō has a number of hit points equal to five times your proficiency bonus. While on you, it uses your AC, otherwise it's 11.
                    
                    ### Shikai Ability
                    At 4th level, you gain two armament abilities, and again at 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level.
                    
                    ### Magic Weapon
                    Starting at 5th level your Zanpakutō counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
                    
                    You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, this bonus increases at levels 9th, 13th and 17th.
                    
                    ### Final Shikai
                    A powerful attack that requires sacrificing your weapon.
                    
                    You gain an Ultimate ability of your choice. Once the chosen ability is used, your Zanpakutō is destroyed. You cannot benefit from any armament abilities while your Zanpakutō is destroyed and cannot activate Shikai or Bankai. Your Zanpakutō takes a number of days to regenerate equal to 10 minus your proficiency bonus.
                    
                    ### Bankai
                    Japanese for final release, it's the final form of a Zanpakutō.
                    
                    To achieve Bankai, one must be able to subjugate their Zanpakutō spirit. Once per day you may enter your "inner world" and attempt to subjugate your Zanpakutō spirit. Your Zanpakutō spirit has the same statistics, Zanpakutō and armament abilities as you.
                    
                    Once your defeat your Zanpakutō, you gain access to Bankai.
                    
                    To activate Bankai you must first be in Shikai. As an action you spend 4 SP and become *Ascended*. You can stay in this form a number of rounds equal to your level plus one. These rounds need not to be consecutive and you can dismiss Bankai as an action, reverting you back to Shikai if you wish.
                    
                    You gain the following benefits while in Bankai.
                    
                    * Your maximum hit points are doubled and you regain 5 hit points per Shinigami level.
                    * You gain an additional armament type and two armament abilities of your choice in the selected armament type.
                    * You gain two additional armament abilities, you only have access to these abilities while in Bankai.
                    * You gain one Ascended ability.
                    
                    Once your Bankai ends, you gain a level of exhaustion.
                    
                    At 15th level and again at 20th level, you gain an Ascended ability and two armament abilities, these additional armament abilities are only available during Bankai.
                    
                    ### Final Bankai
                    This technique is not one that is easily revealed to you by your Zanpakutō. This technique is of tremendous power, but at a great cost. By using this technique, you merge with your Zanpakutō, but afterwards you lose all of your Shinigami powers.

You can speak, use equipment, and wear armor while in this form, and can revert to your normal form as a bonus action. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious or die.

                        **Galvano Javelin:** When you ascend you gain 6 small lightning bolt shaped wings. As a bonus action, you can pull off two of the wings and wield one in each hand as a melee weapon. You are considered proficient in them, they deal damage equal to your base armament damage, except the damage type is changed to lightning, and they have the finesse and light weapon properties.


                        As an action you can spend 6 SP and hurl the javelin in a direction your choose, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding the target must make a DC Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes an additional 4d6 lightning damage.
                        The galvano javelin is consumed and dissipates.

                        **Morphine Pattern (5 SP):** As an action you target a creature with a schrift charge that you can see within 60 feet. That creature makes a Constitution saving throw.

A projectile of reishi forming a line 100-feet-long and 5-feet-wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line that has 100 hit points or fewer, dies.

                        # Chapter 5: Armament Abilities

                        <p> Each Armament (Zanpakutō, Heilge Bogen, or Fullbring) has an armament type, usually listed on the items description.

                        Armament abilities are spell-like abilities and are considered magical, unless otherwise stated.

                        ### Armament Types
                        In this chapter you'll find the following armament types:

                        Acid, Barrier, Blood, Dark, Earth, Fire, Generic, Gravity, Healing, Ice, Illusion, Kidō, Light, Lightning, Oppression, Poison, Projectile, Sound, Summon, Water, Weapon and Wind.

                        There are a few armament types that not all characters have access too. Bow Attributes are only available to Quincy and Hollow abilities can only be selected by Hollow.

                        Generic armament abilities can be selected by anyone, and you don't need to have it selected as one of your armament types to pick abilities from this category.

                        ### Abilities beyond
                        The listed abilities in this book are by no means the only abilities a character can learn. If you desire an ability that is not listed within the book, feel free to speak with your GM on how to incorporate it. 

                        The best section to gain guidance for this would be the *Creating a Spell* section in Chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

                        ### Saving Throws & Requirements
                        The DC to resist one of your armament abilities equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the number of armament abilities you have + any special modifiers.

                        For example, Rukia is using her Cone of Ice weapon ability, her other ice abilities are Cold Form, Ice Weapon, and Freezing weapon, therefore the DC would be 8 + 4 (for her proficiency bonus) + 4 (she has a total of 4 ice abilities) total to a DC 16.

                        Augments are not counted towards your save DC.

                        ### Components
                        Just like spells, armament abilities require components. Most abilities require a new component marked with a "W". This notates that to use the armament ability you must have your armament released, unless otherwise stated.

                        ### Spell Point Cost
                        Armament abilities have an SP cost needed to activate. Each armament ability will list the amount needed.

                        \columnbreak

                        ### Ultimate Abilities
                        Ultimate abilities are special armament abilities that are usually used as a last ditch effort to win, or turn the tides of a battle. Using one greatly drains your reiryoku and comes at a great cost; usually stated by your class or armament.

                        ### Ascended Abilities
                        Ascended abilities can only be selected when stated by your class and can only be used while in an Ascended form. Each Ascended ability can only be used once per Long Rest, unless the ability states otherwise.

                        While ascended, the damage is increased to 3d6 and the target has disadvantage on their Wisdom saving throw.

                        You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 60 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through abjects, ignoring cover.

                        Using divination magic, you create an arrow with the ability to seek out a target. Choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw, on a failed save taking damage as if they were hit by the attack, or half as much on a successful one.

While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

                        a 10-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

                        * You can reshape the material in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension.

                        * You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the material, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for the duration.

                        * If the material you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for the duration.

                        * You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn’t possible.

                        * You transmute rock to mud or vice versa. If you would transmute rock to mud while a creature is within the area they must succeed a strength saving throw or the area is considered difficult terrain. If you would transmute mud to rock, creatures in the area must succeed a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained for the duration. A restrained creature can use it's action to make an additional Strength saving throw to break away from the solidified rock.

                        If you use this ability multiple times, you can only have a number of its non-instantaneous effects, equal to your proficiency bonus, active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
                        Each time you select this ability, the area of the cube you can affect is increased by 5 feet, and the thickness you can affect is increased by 1 foot.

                        You may select this ability multiple times, each time selecting one of the following options:
                        * increase the range by 10 feet.
                        * This ability no longer requires V components.
                        * Increase the duration by 1 hour.
                        * This ability no longer requires Concentration.

                        Until the ability ends, bits of rock spread across your body, and you gain the following benefits:

                        * You reduce any physical damage you take by 3.
                        * This increases by one each time you select this ability.
                        * You can move across difficult terrain made of earth, stone or similar material without spending extra movement.
                        * You may disperse the shield, shooting rock and stone in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on you. Creatures within the sphere must make a dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, they take half damage. Every time you select this ability increase the radius of the sphere by 5 feet.

                        #### Wall of Stone
                        **Requirements:** Mold earth and one other Earth ability
                        ___
                        - **SP Cost:** 2
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, W
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 5 minutes
                        ___
                        A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range.
                        The wall is 3 inches thick and is composed of up to five 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be continuous with at least on other panel. Each time you reselect this ability, the thickness is increased by 1 inch.

                        If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

                        The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. the wall doesn’t need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

                        If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

                        The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 10 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM’s discretion.
                        If you maintain your concentration on this ability for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the ability ends..

                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        * Increase the range by 10 feet.
                        * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
                        * This ability no longer requires Concentration.
                        * You can create an additional panel.

                        Each time you reselect this ability, you gain an additional projectile to a maximum of four. You can direct the additional projectiles at the same target or a different one, you must make a separate attack roll for any additional projectiles..

                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        * This ability no longer requires V components.
                        * The range is increased by 10 feet.

                        ___
                        You strike the ground, creating a tremor that ripples outward from you in a 40-foot radius. Each creature within range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 7d10 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        Each time you reselect this ability the radius is increased by 10 feet.

                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        * This ability no longer requires V components.

                        - **SP Cost:** 3
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 round
                        - **Range:** 120 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, W
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        For the duration of this ability you can cause columns of stone to erupt from the earth. 
                        As an action, you cause column of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet; each time you reselect this ability the diameter and height is increased by 5 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30

                        hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius. The rubble lasts until cleared.

                        If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d8 bludgeoning damage and be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save. If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle.

                        The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice) against the ability's saving throw DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.
                        Each time you reselect this ability, increase the damage by 1d8..

                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        * Increase the range by 20 feet.
                        * This ability no longer requires V components.
                        * As an action, you instead cause two columns of earth to burst from the ground from two different points instead of one.

                        #### Earthquake (Ascended)
                        **Requirements:** Six Earth abilities
                        ___
                        - **SP Cost:** 4
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 round
                        - **Range:** 500 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, W
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. 
                        For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot- radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area. 
                        The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken. 

                        When you use this ability and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone and takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage. 
                        This ability can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM. 

                        **Fissures.** 

                        Fissures open throughout the ability's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens. 
                        A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below). 

                        **Structures.** 

                        The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 20d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.

                        You may select this ability a second time, if you do, the number of fissues is doubled, the size of the fissures are doubled and the damage this ability does to structures is doubled.

                        #### Bedrock (Ascended)
                        **Requirements:** Six Earth abilities
                        ___
                        Your Earth abilities are increased in power. Your armament abilities or Kido that deal bludgeoning damage ignore resistances. If a creature would be immune to bludgeoning damage, it instead takes half damage.

                        You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead. If its soul is free, willing and hasn't been reincarnated, the target returns to life with all its hit points.

                        This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the life; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.

                        This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

                        Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all D20 rolls. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

                        Restoring life to a creature that hasn't been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. While your armament is reforming, you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks and saving throws.

                        On a failed save, the ability creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. The Hollow can see and hear through the sensor as it they were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creatures that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a small luminous orb.

                        |  -5  | Familiar (Hollow knows the target well) |

                        | Save Modifier  | Connection |

                        |  -10  | Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like |

                        Whenever the Hollow would gain another 5 hit die, the amount of hit points regained is increased by 1.

                        As an action, the hollow covers itself and anything it is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes it look like another creature of it's general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hollow takes a bonus action to end it or if it dies.

                        The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hollow could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching it would feel its rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hollow is disguised.

                        Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against the save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature. 

                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:

                        You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

                        The changes wrought by this ability fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this ability to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this ability to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

                        To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your save DC.


                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:

                        * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
                        * This ability no longer requires concentration.
                        * Increase the duration by 1 minute.

                        Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the ability's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

                        If the number rolled is equal to or greaterh than 20 - 8 - the number of duplicates, you may change the attack's target to a duplicate.

                        A duplicates AC equal 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, teh duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The ability ends when all duplicates are destroyed.

                        - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

                        Choose a single creature you can see within range, you project a phantasmal image of that creature’s worst fears that is only visible to that creature. Each time you reselect this ability the range increased by 10 feet.

                        The target must make a Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target’s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d8 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
                        * This ability no longer requires concentration.

                        #### Phantasmal Killer
                        **Requirements:** Four Illusion abilities
                        ___
                        - **SP Cost:** 2
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, W
                        - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This ability has no effect on undead or constructs. Each time you reselect this ability the cube is increased by 5 feet.

                        The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

                        The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the ability ends.

                        While a target is affected by the ability, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

                        An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 4d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area of within 5 fee of the phantasm,

                        \pagebreakNum

                        provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        * Increase the range by 10 feet.
                        * this ability no longer requires V or S components.
                        * This ability no longer requires concentration.
                        * Increase the damage by 1d6.

                        #### Hallucinatory Terrain
                        **Requirements:** Four Illusion abilities
                        ___
                        - **SP Cost:** 2
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, W
                        - **Duration:** 1 minute
                        ___
                        You make terrain in an area up to 20-foot-cube look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. each time

                        Each time you reselect this ability, the cube increases by 5 feet. The terrain’s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

                        Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

                        The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately.

                        A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        * Increase the range by 10 feet.
                        * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
                        * Increase the duration by 1 minute.

                        If the creature can understand you it becomes charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by this ability.

                        Each time you reselect this ability the damage increases by 1d10.

                        You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the ability ends. You can end the ability early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or similar magic or ability also ends it.

                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        * Increase the range by 10 feet.
                        * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
                        * Increase the duration by 1 day.
                        * A creature may take damage more than once each day. You must have selected this ability three times before you can select this option.

                        The target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being charmed.

                        On a successful save, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the ability ends. On a failed save, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target’s space appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can’t see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the ability's duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.

                        You may select this ability a second time, if you do, this ability affects creatures even if they are immune to being charmed and the damage is doubled.

                        ___
                        You ravage your foes with a deadly disease. Whenever a creature is dealt poison damage or gains the poisoned condition from one of your armament abilities or spells,

                        you may infect them with one of your diseases selected from below, your choice. 

                        **Cackle Fever:** Symptoms manifest 1d6 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured.

                        Any event that causes the infected creature great stress — including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare — forces the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute.

                        The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.

                        At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease.

                        **Sewer Plague:** Symptoms manifest 1d6 days after infection and include fatigue and cramps. The infected creatures gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured or as stated below, and it regains only half the normal of hit points from spending Hit Dice and when taking a long rest, the creature must spend Hit Die to regain hit points; spent hit dice are then regained as normal.

                        At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creatures exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion to 0 or below, the creature recovers from the disease.

                        **Sight Rot:** Symptoms manifest 1d6 minutes after infection and include bleeding from the eyes. The creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw, on a failure the penalty worsens by 1. On a success, the penalty is reduced by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal. If a successful saving throw reduced the penalty to 0 or below, the creature recovers from the disease.

                        Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.

                        **Mage Pox:** Symptoms manifest 1d6 minutes after infection and include vertigo and small blue dots across their body. Whenever the creatures casts a spell there is a 10% chance the spell fails. At the end of each long rest

                        \pagebreakNum

                        the creature must make a Constitution saving throw, on a failure the spell failure chance increases by 5%. On a success, its reduced by 5%. If a successful saving throw reduced the spell failure to 0% or below, the creature recovers from the disease.

                        You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        * Reduce the amount of time for symptoms to manifest from a d6 to a d4.
                        * Increase any damage from this ability by 1d6.

                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, W
                        - **Duration:** Concentration, until sealed
                        ___
                        You conjure up a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the ability ends. The wall’s space is difficult terrain.

                        Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall’s space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage
                        is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells and abilities that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen).

                        Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall’s water doesn’t fill it.

                        You may select this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        - Increase the range by 10 feet.
                        - This ability no longer requires V or S components.
                        - This ability no longer requires concentration.
                        - Increase the length, height and diameter of the wall by 10 feet. The thickness is also increased by 1 foot to a maximum of 5 feet.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        The area can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within 30 feet of it, and remains for the next minute.

                        Each time you select this ability, increase the maximum length, width and height by 5 feet.

                        You may select this option multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        - Increase the range by 10 feet.

                        - Increase the save DC by 1.

                        **Requirements:** Five Water abilities
                        ___
                        - **SP Cost:** 3
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 round
                        - **Range:** Sight
                        - **Components:** V, S, W
                        - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 5 rounds
                        ___
                        A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 60 feet high, and 25 feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration.

                        When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes 7d8 bludgeoning damage.

                        At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 25 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 7d8 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall’s height is reduced by 20 feet, and the damage creatures take from the ability on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d8. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height or the duration expires, the ability ends.

                        A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against the save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can’t move. A creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground.

                        You may select this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        - This ability no longer requires V or S components.
                        - Increase the duration by 1 round.
                        - increase the walls length and height by 20 feet, and the thicknes by 5 feet.
                        - Increase the save DC by 2.

                        ___
                        A mass of 20-foot-deep water appears and swirls in a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within range. The point must be on ground or in a body of water. Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be pulled 10 feet toward the center. Once a creature reaches the center, if they would take damage, the hit die is increased by one step and they begin to drown.
                        As an action any creature within the area can make an additional Strength saving throw, however they do so at disadvantage. On a successful save they are able to move.

                        You may select this ability a second time, if you do the range, duration, depth and radius is doubled. The damage dice size is also increased to a d10.

                        You take control of the air in a 5-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you activate this ability. The effect lasts for the duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the

                        - When a creature ends a fall in an updraft, they take no fall damage instead. If a creature jumps within an updraft, their jump height is doubled instead.

                        ___
                        A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 force damage on a failed save and be pushed back 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line, or half as much damage on a successful one and not be pushed back.

                        The wind disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 80 percent chance to extinguish them.

                        You may select this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:

                        #### Tornado (Ultimate)
                        **Requirements:** Five Wind abilities
                        ___
                        - **SP Cost:** 3
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 round
                        - **Range:** 100 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, W
                        - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 5 rounds
                        ___
                        You conjure a raging tornado on a point that you can see on the ground within range, this area must be able to fit the tornado or this ability fails. The tornado is a 40-foot-radius, 80-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the

                        ability ends, you can use your action to move the tornado up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground.

                        The tornado sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren’t secured to anything and that aren’t worn or carried by anyone. A creature must make a Strength saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the tornado or that the tornado enters its space, including when the tornado first appears. A creature takes 7d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top, and takes an additional 7d8 force damage each turn its within the tornado.

                        A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the duration ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against the  save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 × 10 feet away from it in a random direction.

                        This ability deals damage to structures within its radius. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and pieces of the structure are automatically flung outside the area of the tornado potentially damaging nearby creatures. Any creature within 30 ft. of the tornado's radius when a structure collapses within it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,  the creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and doesn't fall prone.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        This also increases the damage any creatures can potentially take by 2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 slashing damage.

                        You may select this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
                        - This ability no longer requires V or S components.
                        - Increase the duration by 1 round.
                        - increase the radius and height by 10 feet.
                        - Increase the save DC by 1.

                        #### Hurricane (Ascended)
                        **Requirements:** Six Wind abilities
                        ___
                        - **SP Cost:** 4
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 round
                        - **Range:** Self
                        - **Components:** V, S, W
                        - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 5 rounds
                        ___
                        You conjure a deadly and devastating storm that descends from the sky. A 60-foot radius, and 60-foot tall cylinder appears centered on you. You are unaffected by your own Hurricane. The ability fails if you can't see a point in the sky where the storm can descend from (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the storm).

                        Within the storm, all ranged attacks and spells always miss their target, being swept away from the raging winds. Vision is lightly obscured, the terrain is difficult, and other creatures have disadvantage on concentration checks.

                        Within the storm you have a fly speed of 60 feet and take no damage from the storm itself, however you can still take damage from flying debris, but you have advantage on dexterity saving throws to avoid debris within the storm.

                        When the storm appears, small and smaller creatures are instantly swept away from the winds. Medium and large creatures must make a Strength saving throw, on a failed save they are swept away from the winds. Huge and larger creatures must make a Strength saving throw with advantage, on a failed save they are swept away by the winds.
                        If a creature begins its turn within the storm they must make a Strength saving throw, taking 10d6 force damage, or half as much on a successful save. If a creature has been swept away by the winds, they have disadvantage on the saving throw.

                        These raging winds also deal damage to structures within the area. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and pieces of the structure are swept by the winds increasing the damage creatures and structures take within the storm by 4d6 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 slashing damage. Each structure that collapses within the area further increases the damage the same amount.

                        A creature that has been swept away by the storm are flung randomly closer to the eye of the storm, or away from the eye by 4d6 x 10 feet. A creature that has been swept away by the storm can spend a bonus action to make a dexterity saving throw against the save DC. On a success, they can control the direction they move in.

                        The eye of the storm is 1/4 the size of the storm and none of the effects of the storm are active within it.

                        You may reselect this ability a second time, if you do the size of the area is doubled.

                        #### Piercing Winds (Ascended)
                        **Requirements:** Six Wind abilities
                        ___
                        Your Wind abilities are increased in power.

                        Your armament abilities or Kido that deal force damage ignore resistances. If a creature would be immune to force damage, it instead takes half damage.

                        # Chapter 6: Kidō
                        Within the world of Bleach, magic works quite differently. Magic isn't drawn from the weave, but rather spells are produced with strong Reiryoku (Spiritual Power). The closest similarity would be how sorcerers casts magic.

                        Spells are traditionally graded by level. Kidō are graded on a scale from 1 to 99, spells of the latter being the most powerful and the most difficult to perform. To use Kidō, a Shinigami must recite the specific incantation for the spell, which is often long and requires few seconds to speak.

                        The power of a spell relies on the power of the user, as even a low-level spell can be utterly devastating when utilized by a high-class Shinigami.

                        There are three main types of Kidō: Bakudō (Was of Binding), Hadō (Way of Destruction), and Kaidō (Healing Kaidō).

                        ### Spell Points
                        This book utilizes the variant Spell Point system for casting spells. In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level.

                        ##### Spell Point Cost
                        | Spell Slot Level  | Point Cost |
                        |:---:|:----:|

                        |  9  | 13 |

                        ### Forbidden Kidō
                        Theres also a classification of Kidō which are considered illegal by Soul Society. The use of such spells will commonly result in some form of lengthy imprisonment or worse. The Kidō spells usually fall under this class are those which involving the manipulation of space, time and Kidō which sacrifices the self.

                        ### Shinigami Spell List
                        The Shinigami spell list is separated into the following three categories:

                        **Bakudō.** These are a broad category of defensive spells which block/repel attacks or immobilize enemies. They may seem subtle, but these spells can give their users a tactical advantage when used properly.

                        **Hadō.** Offensive spells which inflict direct damage to the enemy. Their effectiveness differs depending on the user.

                        **Kaidō.** Broad category of utility spells. Most consisting of spells that either heal or bolster the body.

                        ## Spell Descriptions
                        The spells presented here are new spells, adjusted spells (excluding level changes) and other spells not present in the Players Handbook; all organized in alphabetical order.

                        #### Air Bubble
                        *2nd-level Conjuration*
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** S
                        - **Duration:**  24 hours
                        ___
                        You create a transparent globe around the head of a willing creature you can see within range. The globe is filled with fresh air that lasts until the spell ends. If the creature has more than one head, the globe of air appears around only one of its heads (which is all the creature needs to avoid suffocation, assuming that all its heads share the same respiratory system).

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create two additional globes of fresh air for each slot level above 2nd.

                        #### Anathema
                        *9th-level Enchantment* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 5 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  Special
                        ___
                        You can attempt to pierce the Saketsu and Hakusui of a creature and seal their spiritual power. You make a melee spell attack against a creature you can see within range. On a success the target takes 14d6 necrotic damage and loses access to any magical abilities or effects it has such as spellcasting, class abilities and magical racial abilities.

                        This spell does not affect plants or constructs.

                        At the beginning of each day, the target can make a Constitution saving throw and continue to make saving throws until they either succeed three times or fail three times, whichever comes first. On a third failure, the creature dies. On a third success, this spell ends on that creature.

                        #### Antimagic Ray
                        *8th-level Abjuration* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
                        ___
                        A shimmering beam of energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target is treated as if they were within an Antimagic Field for the duration of this spell.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you create two additional rays.

                        #### Arcanist's Transformation
                        *6th-level Transmutation* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** Self
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a few hairs from a bull)
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
                        ___
                        You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic. Until the spell ends, you can’t cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:

                        * You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.
                        * You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons.
                        * When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra 2d12 force damage.
                        * You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.
                        * You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.
                        * You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.

                        Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

                        #### Arcane Armor

                        #### Blade of Disaster

                        ___
                        You create a blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet long in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The blade lasts for the duration. When you cast this spell, you can make up to two melee spell attacks with the blade, each one against a creature, loose object, or structure within 5 feet of the blade. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage. This attack scores a critical hit if the number on the d20 is 18 or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals an extra 8d12 force damage (for a total of 12d12 force damage).

                        As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and then make up to two melee spell attacks with it again.

                        The blade can harmlessly pass through any barrier, including a wall of force.

                        #### Borrowed Knowledge

                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        A small stroke of lightning forming a line 20 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

                        The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

                        #### Celerity

                        ___
                        You target a willing creature within range. The target can take their Reaction to immediately take an action as if it was their turn. Until your next turn the target cannot take reactions.

                        #### Close Wound
                        *Cantrip Evocation* [Kaidō]
                        ___

                        - **Range:** Touch
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        You touch an ally and channel reiryoku into them to rapidly speed up their natural healing. If the target has at least 1 hit point, it can spend one of its Hit Dice, rolling the die and adding their Constitution modifier to the result. They regain hit points equal to the total.

                        A creature touched by this spell can spend one additional Hit Die when you reach 5th level (2), 11th level (3), and 17th level (4).

                        #### Contingent Resurrection
                        *10th-level Necromancy* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 hour
                        - **Range:** Touch
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
                        - **Duration:**  Until dispelled
                        ___
                        Once cast, the spell remains quiescent and does not activate until the trigger conditions have been met (but each day it remains untriggered, it uses up spell points, even if the character cast it on another creature). Once triggered, the spell is expended. If the subject is killed (the trigger), they are restored to life and complete health 1 minute later, so long as even a tiny bit of the target remains for contingent resurrection to act upon. A radiant flash of light shines from the remaining part of the target, illuminating everything within 20 feet. The creature is restored to full hit points, vigor, and health.

                        However, the subject permanently loses 1 point of Constitution if the subject was 1st level or had 9 or less hit dice. Contingent resurrection does not work on a creature that has died of old age.

                        #### Create Homunculus
                        *6th-level Transmutation* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 hour
                        - **Range:** Touch
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (clay, ash, and madrake root, all of which the spell consumes, and a jewel-encrusted dagger worth at least 1,000 gp)
                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        While speaking an intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking 2d4 piercing damage that can’t be reduced in any way.

                        You then drip your blood on the spell’s other components and touch them, transforming them into a special construct called a homunculus.

                        The statistics of the homunculus are in the Monster Manual. It is your faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus’s hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point, and the change to your and the homunculus’s hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum can’t be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus’s death.

                        You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.

                        #### Crown of Stars
                        *7th-level Evocation*
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** Self
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:** 1 hour
                        ___
                        Seven star-like motes of light appear and orbit your head until the spell ends. You can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended. The spell ends early if you expend the last mote.

                        If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to three motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of motes created increases by two for each slot level above 7th.

                        #### Daichi Tenyō
                        *5th-level Transmutation* [Hadō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
                        ___
                        You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

                        **Creature.** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

                        On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

                        **Object.** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.

                        If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.

                        You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

                        #### Dankū
                        *8th-level Abjuration* [Bakudō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are targeted by an attack, spell or ability
                        - **Range:** Self

                        ___
                        A translucent wall of force springs existence protecting you against harm. When an attack, spell or ability is made against you, the wall blocks it, causing the attack to miss or the spell to have no effect on you.

                        #### Dark Star
                        *8th-level Evocation* [Hadō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 150 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a shard of onyx and a drop of the caster’s blood, both of which the spell consumes)
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        This spell creates a sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere can have a radius of up to 40 feet.

                        The area within this sphere is filled with magical darkness and crushing gravitational force.

                        For the duration, the spell’s area is difficult terrain. A creature with darkvision can’t see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

                        Any creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

                        A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.

                        #### Darts of Life
                        *8th-level Evocation* [Kaidō]

                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  1 hour
                        ___
                        Seven golden star-like motes of light appear and orbit your head until the spell ends. You can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward one creature within 120 feet of you. When you do so, the target regains 4d12 hit points. The spell ends early if you expend the last mote.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to three motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.

                        #### Dawn
                        *5th-level Evocation* [Hadō]
                        ___

                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a sunburst pendant worth at least 100 gp)
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range. Until the spell ends, a 30-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light glimmers there. This light is sunlight.

                        When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder.

                        If you’re within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.

                        #### Dire Winter
                        *10-level Evocation* [Hadō]
                        ___

                        - **Range:** 1 mile
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  24 Hours
                        ___
                        Raging winds and a hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 2 mile radius centered on a point within range. Everything in the storm takes 1 point of cold damage each round. A successful Reflex save results in no damage, but the save must be repeated each round. The intense cold freezes water out of the air, causing constant snowfall and wind. The snow and wind produce a blizzard effect within the Area.

                        Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

                        #### Enemies Abound
                        *3rd-level Evocation*
                        ___

                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        You reach into the mind of one creature you can see and force it to make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature automatically succeeds if it is immune to being frightened. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the spell ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

                        Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, spell, or other ability it’s using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

                        #### Energetic Healing
                        *7th-level Abjuration* [Kaidō]

                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
                        ___
                        This spell converts magical energy damage into healing power. You touch a willing creature rendering it immune to either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage.

                        The next time the target is subjected to magical damage of the chosen type, they instead regain hit points equal to half of the damage that would be dealt. This spell ends early on a creature once they regained a number of hit points equal to 2 x your character level.

                        #### Enervation

                        ___
                        A tendril of inky darkness reaches out from you, touching a creature you can see within range to drain life from it. 
                        The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 2d8 necrotic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage, and until the spell ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal 4d8 necrotic damage to the target. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything

                        else, if the target is ever outside the spell’s range, or if the target has total cover from you.

                        Whenever the spell deals damage to a target, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage the target takes.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

                        When you need to make sure something gets done, you can’t rely on vague promises, sworn oaths, or binding contracts of employment. When you cast this spell, choose one humanoid within range that can see and hear you, and that can understand you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed in this way, it undertakes to perform any services or activities you ask of it in a friendly manner, to the best of its ability.

                        You can set the creature new tasks when a previous task is completed, or if you decide to end its current task. If the service or activity might cause harm to the creature, or if it conflicts with the creature’s normal activities and desires, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect. This save is made with advantage if you or your companions are fighting the creature. If the activity would result in certain death for the creature, the spell ends.

                        When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

                        You impart latent luck to yourself or one willing creature you can see within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can

                        dismiss this spell on itself to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

                        If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

                        You make a ranged weapon attack with your Heilig Bogen using the material component as ammunition (which the spell consumes). On a successful hit, the Seele Schneider stops in mid-air just before hitting the target and surrounds them in a 10-foot cube barrier of high density Reishi for the duration. 

                        Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

                        During the duration, as an action, you cause the barrier to collapse in on itself crushing the target within and then exploding in an enormous explosion. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 3d6 force damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one.

                        Choose a spell of 7th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you or an ally. You cast that spell (called the contingent spell) as part of casting greater contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. The target describes that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a greater contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when the target is engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

                        When the circumstance is met for the first time for the contingent spell, the target may have the spell take effect. If they do, greater contingency ends. If not, the spell persists until the circumstance is met again.

                        The contingent spell takes effect only on the target, even if it can normally target others.

                        A creature can only have one contingency spell active on them at a time. Also, contingency ends on the target if its material component is ever not on their person.

                        *7th-level Illusion* [Bakudō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 hour
                        - **Range:** 120 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:** 24 hours
                        ___
                        You cause a temple to shimmer into existence in an area you can see within range. The temple is a cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. The area within the temple is removed from existence and removes the space from all outsider's consciousness. When you cast this spell you can choose any number of creatures that are not affected by this spell. Additionally, while this spell is active, you can perform a 1 minute ritual and expend a 3rd level or higher spell slot to add or remove creatures affected by the spell or not.

                        The temple matches any surrounding buildings or terrain and appears ordinary. All creatures subconsciously avoid the area and the thought of approaching the temple does not occur.

                        In addition, sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the temple, and creatures within can’t be targeted by divination spells.

                        The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple’s interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple’s exterior. It can’t be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.

                        Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

                        The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can’t be extinguished by nonmagical means.

                        If damage from this spell kills a target, the target is turned to ash.

On a failed save the creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this spell for the next 24 hours.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.

                        Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d10 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can’t heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

                        As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

                        You can see and hear into the past, getting a look at events that happened previously at your current location. The level of detail you see and hear by means of this spell depends on the span of time you wish to observe;

                        concentrating on a span of days renders a more detailed perspective than a span of centuries, for example. You can view only one span of time per casting, chosen from the following options:

                        **Days:** You sense the events of the past, stretching back 1 + 1d6 days. You gain detailed knowledge of the people, conversations, and events that transpired.

                        **Weeks:** You gain a summary of the events of the past, stretching back 1d4 weeks. Exact wording and details are lost, but you know all the participants and the highlights of the conversations and events that took place.

In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn’t already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.

                        Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw.

                        - **Components:** S
                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
                        ___
                        By gathering threads of shadow material from the Shadowfell, you create a Huge shadowy dragon in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The illusion lasts for the spell’s duration and occupies its space, as if it were a creature.

                        When the illusion appears, any of your enemies that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

                        As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 60 feet. At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space. When you create the dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 7d6 damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

                        The illusion is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to create it, but attacks miss it automatically, it succeeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. A creature that uses an action to examine the dragon can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and has advantage on saving throws against its breath.

                        So long as you maintain concentration on this spell, you cannot be killed or incapacitated by effects, spells or attacks that reduce you to 0 or fewer hit points. If you take such damage, you can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the damage taken. If you fail this save, you die or fall unconscious (as appropriate). If this save is successful, you are still alive and conscious, with 1 hit point remaining.

                        This spell provides no protection against effects that slay you without dealing hit point damage.

                        After you attempt three Constitution saving throws to avoid death or unconsciousness by this spell, this spell automatically ends.

                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** Touch

                        - **Duration:** 1 hour
                        ___
                        You touch an object that weighs no more than 10 pounds and cause it to become magically fixed in place. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can move the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute.

                        If the object is fixed in the air, it can hold up to 4,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the object to fall. Otherwise, a creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can move the object up to 10 feet.

                        **At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or 5th level, the DC to move the object increases by 5, it can carry up to 8,000 pounds of weight, and the duration increases to 24 hours. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the DC to move the object increases by 10, it can carry up to 20,000 pounds of weight, and the effect is permanent until dispelled.

                        ___
                        You hold your hand out to a humanoid within range and overwhelm it with your reiatsu. If the creature you choose has 30 hit points of fewer, it falls into a magical slumber. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

                        The creature falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake.

                        Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, increase the hit point threshold by 10 for each slot level above 4th.

                        - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
                        ___
                        For the duration, you or one willing creature you can see within range has resistance to psychic damage, as well as advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

                        ___
                        By sacrificing a piece of your own body you create a massive pillar of energy the shape of a Katana tip. A cylinder that is 200 feet tall and 50 feet wide appears on a point centered on you. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw; you have disadvantage on this saving throw. A target takes 100 + your Hit Die in fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

                        The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

                        You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.

                        This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.

                        #### Kakushitsuijaku 
                        *5th-level Divination* [Bakudō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action

                        Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature's location as well as

                        \pagebreakNum

                        coordinates of it's location, as long as that creature is within the same plane. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement. If the creature is on a different plane, you only get the name of the plane they're on and the spell ends.

                        #### Keikaigi
                        *9th-level Conjuration* [Bakudō]

                        ___
                        You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.

                        The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

                        Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

                        From your outstretched hand a number of roman numeral-inscribed constructs shoot out into the ground, several towering columns of Reishi, shaped like the Quincy Cross, erupt upwards in a circular formation around you. 

                        A 40-foot radius 60-foot high column centered on you springs into existence. Any creature (other than you) that enters the area for the first time, moves within the area for the first time, starts or ends their turn within the area, must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 8d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

                        #### Bankin
                        *9th-level Abjuration* [Bakudō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
                        - **Range:** 30 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)
                        - **Duration:**  Until dispelled
                        ___
                        You create magical restraints to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again.

                        While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.

                        When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.

                        **Burial.** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.

                        The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.

                        **Chaining.** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.

                        **Hedged Prison.** The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.

                        **Minimus Containment.** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.

                        **Slumber.** The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.

                        **Ending the Spell.** During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.

                        The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

                        A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

                        ___
                        You hurl a ball of red energy at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 8d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 7th.

                        ___
                        This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

                        The destination you choose must be familiar to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you.

                        - **Incantation:**  *Seeping crest of turbidity. Arrogant vessel of lunacy! Boil forth and deny! Grow numb and flicker! Disrupt sleep! Crawling queen of iron! Eternally self-destructing doll of mud! Unite! Repulse! Fill with soil and know your own powerlessness!*
                        ___
                        You create a 20-foot-cube of destructive gravitational force centered on a point you can see within range. For the spell’s duration, the cube and any space within 30 feet of it are difficult terrain, and nonmagical objects fully inside the cube are destroyed if they aren’t being worn or carried.

                        A creature that starts its turn within the cube takes 8d10 force damage and is restrained until it is no longer in the cube. If the sphere is in the air, the restrained creature hovers inside the sphere.

                        A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending this restrained condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach.

                        You create nine black holes with purple oultines that surround a creature within range you can see. The black holes emit immense gravitational energy on the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is incapacitated and restrained for the duration.

                        A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

                        #### Legend Lore
                        *5th-level Divination* [Bakudō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
                        - **Range:** Self
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (incense worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each)
                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        Name or describe a person, place, or object and you choose Legend or Lore.

                        If you choose lore the spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant and common known information about the thing you named. 

                        If you choose legend the spell brings to your mind current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. The information you learn is accurate but might be shrouded in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word of their land on the lips."

                        Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness.

                        Nonmagical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can’t illuminate the area.

                        Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere,

                        it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Each creature in the sphere on the turn when you cast the spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 force damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its speed.

                        Until the start of your next turn, any object that isn’t being worn or carried in the sphere requires a successful Strength check against your spell save DC to pick up or move.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

                        The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.

                        If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.

                        You impart two motes of luck on up to 5 creatures you can see within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can expend a mote of luck to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can expend a mote to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

                        If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

                        Choose up to 6 six creatures you can see within range. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.

                        The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.

Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

                        When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

                        *9th-level Transmutation* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 120 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cacoon)
                        - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
                        ___
                        You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on a

                        Wisdom saving throw to resist the transformation. An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.

                        Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or half the target’s level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.

                        Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points can’t be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has

                        no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.

                        The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It can’t speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech.

                        The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

                        You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell that only it perceives. One creature you can see within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. The target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being charmed. On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target's space appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spell's duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.

                        #### Mighty Fortress
                        *8th-level Conjuration* [Bakudō]
                        ___

                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)
                        - **Duration:** Instantaneous
                        ___
                        A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground of your choice that you can see within range. The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.

                        The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress’s outer wall.

                        A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.

                        A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell.

                        The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM’s discretion.

                        After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.

                        Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target’s location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

                        You psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage, and it can’t take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell’s other effects.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V
                        - **Duration:** 1 hour
                        ___
                        You address allies, staff, or innocent bystanders to exhort and inspire them to greatness, whether they have anything to get excited about or not. Choose up to five creatures within range that can hear you. For the duration, each affected creature gains 5 temporary hit points and has advantage on Wisdom saving throws. If an affected creature is hit by an attack, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes. Once an affected creature loses the temporary hit points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the temporary hit points increase by 5 for each slot level above 3rd.

                        - **Components:** V, M (a broken bone & a square of black silk)
                        - **Duration:** Instantaneous
                        ___
                        You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a zombie at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the zombie are in the Monster Manual.

                        If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn’t make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.

                        Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell or spell-like effect of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

                        * You have a +2 bonus to AC.
                        * All your weapon attacks are magical, and when you make a weapon attack, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        * You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that lets you attack more than once when you take the Attack action on your turn.

                        #### Peripety
                        *10th-level Abjuration* [Bakudō]

                        #### Permanency
                        *9th-level Enchantment* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 hour

                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a gem per level of the spell, each worth 500 gp, minimum one gem; which the spell consumes)
                        - **Duration:** Until dispelled
                        ___
                        This spell allows you to make certain spells permanent. Choose an active spell within range. That spell must meet the following requirements to be affected:

                        * The spell cannot have targeted more than one creature, but can have an area that affects more than one creature

                        The affected spell then gains the following traits:

                        * The duration is changed to "Until dispelled."
                        * If the spells duration would end if triggered, it continues to persist until dispelled.
                        * If the spell would be affected by Dispel Magic or similar, instead of the spell ending, Permanency ends.

                        This spell and affected spells can still be subjected to antimagic fields.

                        #### Platinum Shield

                        You create a field of silvery light that surrounds a creature of your choice within range (you can choose yourself). The field sheds dim light out to 5 feet. While surrounded by the field, a creature gains the following benefits:

                        **Cover.** The creature has half cover.

                        **Damage Resistance.** The creature has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison damage.

                        **Evasion.** If the creature is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the creature instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

                        As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the field to another creature within 60 feet of the field.

                        *7th-level Enchantment* [Hadō]

                        ___
                        You speak a word of power that causes waves of intense pain to assail one creature you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to crippling pain. Otherwise, the spell has no effect on it. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being charmed.

                        While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.

                        A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.

                        You unleash a shimmering lance of psychic power from your forehead at a creature that you can see within range. Alternatively, you can utter a creature’s name. If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell’s target even if you can’t see it. If the named target isn’t within range, the lance dissipates without effect.

                        The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7d6 psychic damage and is incapacitated until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t incapacitated.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

                        ___
                        You create intense pressure, unleash it in a 30-foot cone, and decide whether the pressure pulls or pushes creatures and objects. Each creature in that cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. And every creature that fails the save is either pulled 15 feet toward you or pushed 15 feet away from you, depending on the choice you made for the spell.

                        In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the cone are likewise pulled or pushed 15 feet.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the distance pulled or pushed increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

                        You create a 20-foot radius circle of reishi on a point you can see within range. Two reishi columns form on any point on the perimeter of the circle you choose. These columns then turn into bows of reishi. These bows have a range of 30 feet and deal 2d8 radiant damage.

                        During the duration, you can spend an action to make a ranged spell attack for each bow against a creature within the circle.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius increases by 5 feet and you create an additional bow.

                        Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

                        At then end of the line theres an explosion with a 20-foot radius. Each creature in the radius must makes Dexterity saving throw. a creatures takes 4d6 lightning damage and 4d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

                        ___
                        This spell summons a swirling thunderstorm at a point you can see within range that rains fire rather than raindrops down a two-mile radius. Everything in the flaming deluge takes 1 point of fire damage each round. A successful Reflex save results in no damage, but the save must be repeated each round. Unless the ground is exceedingly damp, all vegetation is eventually blackened and destroyed, leaving behind a barren wasteland similar to the aftermath of a grass or forest fire. The fiery storm is stationary and not affected by any wind or weather, unless its from a wish spell or 10th level spell.

                        ___
                        You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of destructive gravitational force centered on a point you can see within range. For the spell’s duration, the sphere and any space within 100 feet of it are difficult terrain, and nonmagical objects fully inside the sphere are destroyed if they aren’t being worn or carried.

                        When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, unsecured objects within 100 feet of the sphere are pulled toward the sphere’s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.

                        A creature that starts its turn within 100 feet of the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the sphere’s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        A creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5d10 force damage and is restrained until it is no longer in the sphere. If the sphere is in the air, the restrained creature hovers inside the sphere.

                        A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending this restrained condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is annihilated, along with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.

                        ___
                        You shatter the barriers between realities and timelines, thrusting a creature into turmoil and madness. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it can’t take reactions until the spell ends. The affected target must also roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns; the number rolled determines what happens to the target, as shown on the Reality Break Effects table.

                        At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.

                        | d10  | Effect |
                        |:---:|:-----------|
                        |  1-2  | Vision of the Far Realm. The target takes 6d12 psychic damage, and it is stunned until the end of the turn. |
                        |  3-5  | Rending Rift. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
                        |  6-8  | Wormhole. The target is teleported, along with everything it is wearing and carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. The target also takes 10d12 force damage and is knocked prone. |
                        |  9 - 10  | Chill of the Dark Void. The target takes 10d12 cold damage, and it is blinded until the end of the turn. |

                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 hour
                        - **Range:** Touch
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.

                        The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's appearance to change. The GM rolls a d6 on a 1-3 the creature's appearance completely changes, on a 4-6 they retain their previous appearance.

                        The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences and retains the capabilities it had in its original form.

                        If the creature is currently under the effects of Bakudo #4 Hainawa, the target is instead incapacitated and you do not need to concentrate on this spell.

                        #### Screen
                        *9th-level Illusion* [Bakudō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
                        - **Range:** 30 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  24 hours
                        ___
                        This spell creates a powerful protective illusion in a 30-foot-cube area you can see within range or up to 7 creatures you choose within range. The chosen area or creatures are protected by divination effects and direct observation.

                        When casting this spell, you can dicate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area. For example, you could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. Or that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible. Sights, sounds, touch, texture and temperature are created appropriate for the illusion. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.

                        Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. If a spell would attempt to locate an affected creature, or object on one of those creatures, you can choose to have the spell fail or see the image stated by you with no save allowed. Additionally, any sensors creatured by such spells become visible within the area.

                        Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

                        If this bonus to your AC would cause the attack to be unsuccessful, and the attack was a melee attack, the attacker is pushed back 10 feet away.

When you arrange the following barriers as three walls and Hōyoku no Jōmon as the roof, a cube is formed enclosing the area. When the barrier is created, you choose Defensive or Offensive. Each wall will apply its listed effect to the interior of the barrier.

                        **Ryūbi no Jōmon.** You create multiple pillars, each one being five feet wide, 50 feet tall and 5 feet thick, forming a gigantic shield or door-like barrier on a point within range. The barrier is 50 feet wide, 100 feet tall and 20 feet thick. Each pillar has an AC of 10 and 20 hit points per inch of thickness.

                        *Defensive.* Friendly creatures regain the maximum number of hit points from any healing.

                        **Kokō no Jōmon.** You create a circular barrier with a 25 foot radius and 10 feet thick that takes the shape of a watermill. As an action, its inner section can be opened up like a set of fangs allowing passage through the barrier. 

                        *Defensive.* When friendly creatures makes a saving throw, they can roll a d10 and add the number rolled to the saving throw.

                        *Offensive.* When Hostile creatures makes a saving throw, they can roll a d10 and subtract the number rolled to the saving throw.

                        **Kigai no Jōmon.** You create a barrier of many small hexagons, forming a honeycomb-like structure resembling a turtle shell. This barrier is 50 feet wide, 100 feet tall and 5 feet thick. The barrier has an AC of 10, each hexagon has 10 hit points per inch and a damage threshold of 10. Additionally, when the barrier is subjected to a Hadō spell, it is reflected back at the caster, using the same save DC, spell attack roll and damage.

                        *Defensive.* Friendly creatures gain resistance to all damage.

The lampshade is 50 feet in diameter and affects everything directly underneath it. The barrier has an AC of 10 and 100 hit points, and is immune to fire damage. All friendly creatures underneath the barrier benefit from the Defensive trait.

                        You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn’t already benefiting from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.

                        #### Soul Cage
                        *7th-level Necromancy* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** Reaction (which you take when a humanoid you can see within 60 feet of you dies)
                        - **Range:** 60 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny silver cage worth 300 gp)

                        ___
                        This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can’t be revived.

                        **Steal Life.** You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points.

                        **Query Soul.** You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

                        **Borrow Experience.** You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul’s life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don’t use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

                        **Eyes of the Dead.** You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you’re currently on.

                        The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

                        \pagebreakNum

                        You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.

                        A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using see invisibility or truesight) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.

                        You are able to temporarily tap into the consciousness of another sentient creature with whom you are familiar with. The target must make a Charisma saving throw, on success it prevents the telepathic connection. Whether the saving throw is successful or not, the target is unaware of the attempted intrusion.

                        Once the connection is created, you are able to hear, see, feel, smell, taste and experience everything the target senses and experiences. You cannot control the subject, however. During this time, your own body remains in a trance-like state. If the target takes damage, you feel the injures as well, although you suffer no actual ill effects. If the target is knocked unconscious or killed, the spell immediately ends.

                        ___
                        You create a magical ward on a creature. If the warded creature would be targeted by level 1st through 9th level spells, the warded creature is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the warded creature, turning the caster into the target. Spells that affect an area, such as a fireball, do not harm or affect the warded creature.

                        This spell refelcts other spells cast at you, back at their caster. When a spell or spell-like effect targets you, you can spend your reaction to reflect the effect. If the spell is 6th level or lower you automatically reflect the spell. Otherwise, you make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell or effect instead affects the original caster, it's DC save, if any, uses yours.

                        This spell ends if you would become unconscious or die.

                        In addition, any creature of your choice that you can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

When damage is dealt to one of them, the same damage is dealt to the other one. If hit points are restored to one of them, the same number of hit points are restored to the other one. If either of the tethered creatures is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends on both. If the spell ends on one creature, it ends on both.

                        #### Time Ravage
                        *9th-level Necromancy* [Hadō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 90 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (an hourglass filled with diamond dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
                        - **Duration:**  Instantaneous
                        ___
                        You target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical form through the devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save fails, the target also ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before it dies of old age. In this aged state, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its walking speed is halved. Only the wish spell or the greater restoration cast with a 9th-level spell slot can end these effects and restore the target to its previous age.

                        #### Tiny Servant
                        *4th-level Transmutation* [Kaidō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
                        - **Range:** Touch
                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  8 hours
                        ___
                        You touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that isn’t attached to another object or a surface and isn’t being carried by another creature. The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points. See Tiny Servant for its statistics.

                        As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take

                        and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures.

                        Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.

                        When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 3rd.

                        #### #73 Tozanshō
                        *7th-level Evocation* [Bakudō]
                        ___
                        - **Casting Time:** 1 action
                        - **Range:** 100 feet
                        - **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)
                        - **Duration:**  1 hour
                        - **Incantation:**  Words
                        ___
                        An immobile, opaque, light-blue, prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.

                        The prison in the shape of a inverted-pyramid, each four sides base 20 feet wide and a height of 40 feet.

                        When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

                        A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends

                        into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

                        This spell can't be dispelled by dispel magic. You can use an action to dismiss this spell early.

                        #### Transcend Mortality

                        - **Components:** V, S
                        - **Duration:**  5 minutes
                        ___
                        Your body surges with god-like arcane power. For the duration you gain the following benefits:

                        * You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.
                        * All of your ability scores become 20.
                        * You gain a flying speed of 100 feet.
                        * You gain resistance to all damage.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        * You gain proficiency in all saving throws.
                        * You have advantage on attack rolls.
                        * You have advantage on saving throws.

                        Although this spell grants you immense power, it comes at a horrific price. You gain these benefits by using up all of your reiryoku. When the spell ends, you are instantly slain and your body disintegrates into nothing. This effect cannot be prevented by any means.

                        #### Tsuriboshi
                        *3rd-level Conjuration* [Bakudō]

                        You conjure a blue ball of energy at a point of your choice within range. Ropes shoot out from the ball anchoring to nearby solid masses (such as walls, buildings, or trees) and the ball expands into a 10-foot radius elastic-like cushion.

                        This cushion can hold up to 1000 pounds of weight before breaking. Any creatures or objects that fall into this cushion negates any falling damage.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the weight the cusion can support increases by 1000 pounds and the cushion itself increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

                        #### Tsuzuri Raiden

On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

                        **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

                        # Chapter 7: Equipment

                        Within this chapter you'll find many of the equipment and magic items seen throughout the Bleach series. However, they're not very prominent in the series as it revolves around the Zanpakutō. 

                        Some of these items are able to be purchased, but some might only be available to certain factions, regulated or not so easily accessible.

                        ## Magic Items
                        Magic items tend to be a rarity within the canon series. Most seen within the series are created by the 12th division of the Gotei 13, or other individuals associated with the division.

                        Most magic items are spirit-tech, a mix of technology and magic.

                        ## Magic Item Descriptions
                        This section presents an assortment of magic items in alphabetical order. See the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for the rules on magic items.

When used, the cube is expended and traps the subject in a separate, alternate dimension.

                        As an action you make a melee attack against a creature within 5 feet. If successful, you banish the creature into a featureless box-shaped demiplane.

                        If the target is a hollow, they instead remain there for 1 hour per two hit dice they possess (minimum 1 hour). At the end of each hour, the hollow can make a constitution saving throw DC 15, if successful the duration is reduced by 1 hour.

                        Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement)

                        The Spirit Restriction Seal is a badge with a symbol unique to the wearers division. Usually worn on ones upper-arm this seal is given to Lieutenants and Captains when they need to venture into the Human Realm. This badge restricts ones spiritual energy in order not to cause unnecessarily high damage while there.

                        While attuned to this item the wearer receives a -1 x half their proficiency bonus (rounded down) penalty on all d20 rolls and their maximum hit points are reduced by 2 x their proficiency bonus.

                        In cases where their full power is needed, they can request a limit release. As an action they can state the command, Gentei Kaijo (limiter release), to unattune with this item.

                        #### Gigai
                        Wondrous Item, Very Rare

                        A faux body is an artificial body that allows Shinigami to inhabit and be able to interact with the material plane.

                        When the Gigai is hosted by a Shinigami, it assumes the appearance of its host, who can now be seen by normal Humans they happen to be around while residing in the Gigai. The Gigai does not take on the clothes its Shinigami host is wearing, and thus, they must acquire modern clothes in order to blend in with the Humans.

                        As an action a non-corporeal creature can inhabit or leave the Gigai.

                        #### Gokon Tekkō
                        Wondrous Item, Rare

                        It usually takes the form of a tight, red, wrist-length glove with fingers that only reach the first knuckle of the hand and a large insignia of a skull shrouded in blue flames on the back.

                        While equipped, as an action you can make an unarmed strike against a corporeal creature. If successful, and the body has a soul, it is shuntted out into a square adjacent to the body.

                        #### Hollow Bait

                        #### Hōgyoku
                        Wondrous Item, Artifact

                        This small, bluish-purple orb composed of a unique substance has ability to sense the hearts of those around it and materialize their deepest desire.

                        **Overbearing Power**      
                        The Hōgyoku has the following random properties:        
                        * 2 minor beneficial properties
                        * 2 major beneficial properties

                        **Desire Materialization**      
                        Though initially thought to solely possess the power to control the boundary of the two contravening existences, that of Shinigami and Hollows, this was proven incorrect. Rather, the Hōgyoku's true power is the ability to absorb the desires of those around it and manifest them into reality. However, this power is not without limitations. The Hōgyoku itself is merely a guiding force - it can only manifest the desires of those with the strength to carry them out.

                        Any creature within 60 feet of the Hōgyoku, and is aware of it and it's abilities, can cast Wish  without spending Spell Points or needing material components. A creature can only cast Wish this way once.

                        If a creature is not aware of the Hōgyoku and/or its abilities, its desire is materialized as per the table.

                        | Desire  | Effects |
                        |:---|:-----------:|
                        |  Greed  | You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. |
                        | Rescue | You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.
                        |Protect | You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. |
                        | Regret | You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. |
                        |  Power  | Choose one ability score to increase by +2 or all ability scores to increase by +1 or gain a feat or gain an armament ability |

                        **Hollowfication**          
                        As an action you can target a Shinigami, it gains the Visored supernatural gift and immediately begins their Inner Battle.

                        **Arrancarfication**       
                        As an action you can target a Hollow, it instantly gains a number of HD to meet the HD requirement for the Arrancar class. Additionally, it gains two Hollow abilities and 3 levels in the Arrancar class.

                        **Fusion**      
                        After performing an 8 hour uninterrupted ritual you can embed the Hōgyoku, fusing with it. While imbedded no creature (other than you) can benefit from the Desire Materialization ability. Additionally you get 3 Hollow

                        \pagebreakNum

                        abilities you must spend in the High-Speed Regeneration Hollow ability. The longer you are fused with the Hōgyoku it begins to further understand your heart and restructures your soul and triggers a transformation.

                        **Transformation**      
                        This transformation can widely vary in appearance and abilities. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your transformation.

                        #### Kaikyō Kotei
                        Wondrous Item, Very Rare

                        The Realm Boundary Fixation prongs are special tools used in the Dangai to stop the Kōryū. Normally, lower-echelon Shinigami enter the dimension in great numbers and using a special method, pour in their Reiatsu to fixate the current.

                        However, individuals in possession of significant quantities of Reiatsu can single-handedly suppress the current for extended periods of time, but only after the insertion of four small forked blades into various locations along the Dangai's wall, and as long as the user remains connected to these items for the duration.

                        While the prongs are in place, you are considered Restrained and you must Concentrate. While concentrating, each hour, you must make a Reiatsu check. On a success, the Kōryū remains in place and inert within 40 feet of you. Once you stop concentrating or fail the Reiatsu check you gain a level of exhaustion for each 4 hours you spent concentrating (maximum 5 levels).

                        #### Karakura-Raizer Watch
                        Wondrous Item, Legendary (requires attunement by a Human or Artificial Soul with no class levels)

                        The Karakura-Raizer team was created by Kisuke Urahara to help protect Karakura Town from Hollow attacks. The Karakura-Raizer Watch takes the form of a golden wrist-watch with a "K" on it's face plate and two buttons, one on each side. It also functions as a Denreishinki.

                        There are six total watches, each one uniquely made for its wearer. Additionally, when activated it produces a unique costume for it's wearer.

                        While attuned, the creature can activate the watch as an action, transforming into a Karakura-Raizer. This transformation lasts in increments of 1 minute for a total of 4 minutes. To regain a minute, the watch must be charged for 2 hours (it comes with a charging cable). 

                        When activated, the watch sends out a non-lethal explosion from the watch in a 5-foot radius centered on the creature. Once the explosion clears, the creature is revealed with it's new costume. After stating their Karakura-Raizer name and striking a pose, another non-lethal explosion blossoms behind them for dramatic flare. If the creature doesn't strike their pose and state their name, they are dealt 4d6 electric damage.

                        While active, the creature has access to the following benefits:
                        * The creature gains the Spiritual Awareness racial trait
                        * The creature can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of their unarmed strike
                        * A feat of their choice
                        * Any 10 armament abilities they qualify for (except Hollow abilities)
                        * Max hit points are doubled
                        * They gain 10 bonus Spell Points

                        #### Kikanshinki
                        Wondrous Item, Very Rare

                        The Account-Replacing Spirit Device is a memory substitution device used by Shinigami on creatures that have seen Shinigami or Hollows. The device takes on many different forms, but the most common form is a pez-like dispenser with an animal head that pops up from the top of the device and produces a puff of smoke.

                        The Kikanshinki has 6 charges. With this item in hand, you can use your action to expend any number of charges to cast Modify Memory targeting a single creature per charge expended (spell save DC 15); No components required. 

                        The Kikanshinki regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dusk.

                        #### Leiden Hant
                        Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement by a Quincy)

                        German for Suffering Grip, but more commonly known as the Sanrei Glove, is a white glove which extends up the forearm, stopping two inches from the elbow. This glove can significantly increase a Quincy's power once they've finished training with it, but at a detrimental cost if the glove is ever removed or unattuned.

                        When a Quincy attunes to the Leiden Hant, the training begins. 

                        While attuned, the glove begins to repel reishi, making it difficult to Summon your bow. You must spend an action to summon your bow.

                        The final step requires you to keep your bow from dissipated while simultaneously firing arrows as frequently as possible. You must continuously do this at least 8 hours per day. At the end of each day you must make a Concentration check (DC 16). Once you've succeeded seven times on this check, your training is completed and you gain the following benefits:

                        * Your Heilig Bogen level is considered one level higher
                        * Your Spell Point Pool is increased by a number of points equal to your proficiency bonus + 1
                        * Your Hirenkyaku is increased by 5 feet
                        * You gain access to the Letzt Stil (Last Style) form. As a bonus action, you can remove the glove and enter this form for a number of rounds equal to your level. While in this form, you gain the following benefits: You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Quincy level, your Hirenkyaku is increased by 10 feet and your Heilig Bogen damage rolls are always maxed.

                        Once the duration ends, or you are knocked unconscious or die you lose access to all your Quincy Class Features.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        There is a way for you to regain you powers after removing the glove, though its very difficult. First you must train with another Quincy of equal or greater HD. You must exhaust yourself mentally and physically, then be hit exactly 19mm to the right of your heart with a Heilig Pfeil. Once this happens, a pentacle-shapped scar will form on the point of impact, and your Quincy Class Features are restored.

                        #### Medallion
                        Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires attunement by a Quincy)

                        This device is a thin, metallic round, and palm sized device with the Wandenreich's insignia etched onto it's surface. These are possessed by select members of the Wandenreich military, including all Sternritter. When presented to a single released Bankai, the device emits five streams of dark enery that cause the Shinigami's Bankai to disintegrate. The Bankai is medalized and the victim effectively loses their Bankai, and is left incapable of communicating with their Zanpakutō.

                        While the Medallion is in hand, when a Shinigami release their Bankai, as a reaction you can activate the medallion stealing their Bankai. If the Bankai's owner HD is equal to or less than yours, as an action you can activate their Bankai and use it as if it was your own.

                        While you have a Bankai medalized, you cannot activate Vollständig. Additionally, the medallion is incapable of stealing an Arrancar's Resurrección, or a Shinigami's Bankai if they have Hollow powers.

                        #### Razor wire

                        | Weapon Type | Cost | Damage | Weight | Properties |
                        |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
                        |  Exotic  | 10gp | 1d4 slashing | 1 lb. | Finesse, Two-handed |

                        The Razor Wire is a long spool of thin steel, nearly 8 feet, delicately woven together like a braid resembling a jump rope. It's thick enough to be swung around and be durable, but thin enough to be sharp and concealable. The ends are weighted cylinders of metal, making the weapon ideal for slashing out like a whip.

                        Proficiency with the Razor Wire allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.

                        #### Reiatsu-Concealing Cloak
                        Wondrous Item, Legendary (requires attunement)

                        This cloak functions as a Cloak of Invisibility and also makes your reaitsu undetectable while invisible.

                        #### Reishūkaku (Spirit Core)
                        Wondrous Item, Uncommon

                        The Spirit Core is a medium-sized orb composed of a clear material that is inscribed with a red crane insignia it is created and used by the Shiba Clan. While infused with Reiryoku, the Reishūkaku produces a semi-transparent blue barrier, referred to as a "cannonball", around the one holding it, protecting them from outside forces.

                        The Reishūkaku can also be used in direct combat for protecting the use from enemy attacks, as well as to save oneself from a fall by remaining suspended in midair and floating upward.

                        As an action, you can spend 5 SP to create a 5-foot sphere centered on you, this sphere functions as a Globe of Invulnerability, but requires concentration. At the beginning of each of your turns, you must spend 5 SP to maintain the sphere. Additionally, as a reaction when you would fall, you can activate the Reishūkaku and negate any fall damage.

                        If would lose concentration, the sphere explodes in a 40-foot sphere dealing a number of 1d6 force damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16), on a success taking half damage.

                        #### Ryūkotsujō
                        Rod, Very Rare

                        The Dragon Bone is a long, beige, bone-like rod , with a small, white, bird-shaped skull, and four protrusions, similar to finger bones, extending from the back of the skull. By channeling Reiryoku into the wand, it produces a tentacle, which acts a harness, and a single bat-like wing which acts as a one-handed hang-glider. 

                        While the rod is in hand, you can spend 10 sp any number of times and cast Fly (no components required). The duration lasts for a number of minutes equal to the amount of times you spent 10 sp.

                        #### Seele Schneider (Soul Cutter)
                        Wondrous Item, Rare

                        German for soul cutter, the Seele Schneider is a thin, silver-colored weapon which, when activated, sports a glowing blue blade. It functions much like a chainsaw, with Reishi making 3 million round trips per second around the edge of the blade. Its vibrations loosens the bonds between the Reishi of whatever it cuts in order to make them easier to capture. 

                        The Selle Schneider is used primarily as an arrow, but can be used as a blade which functions as a dagger but deals 1d6 damage instead. The Seel Scheider has it's own SP pool, maximum 20 and starts at 0.

                        Anhäufer: While wielding this item, any time a creature casts a spell, the Seele Schneider gains a number of SP equal to the spells level. Any time a creature uses a spell-like ability, the seele scheider gains 1 SP. The Seele Schneider gains a +1 bonus for each 5 SP it has in it's pool. This bonus is applied to damage rolls when used as an arrow; this bonus is also added to attack and damage rolls when used as a melee weapon. Once used as an arrow, it's SP pool is depleted. The SP pool also depletes after 1 minute or the end of combat, whichever comes sooner.

                        #### Shihōin Shield
                        Wondrous Item, Artifact

                        It is a large, shield-like item with the Shihōin family crest stamped on it, a long cord connected to it and a long rod, and two vertical slots running from its top.

                        \pagebreakNum

                        To utilize this magic item, it requires two Zanpakutō. As an action, make a ranged melee attack against a target within 40 feet. On a success the rod is launched at, and wraps around the target, binding it with the cord. The target is grappled. While the object is grappled, as an action you and an adjacent creature can slot in your Zanpakutō and channel your Reiryoku. The grappled creature takes Xd6 force damage, where x is the combined total HD of both Zanpakutō wielders. If the target is a creature, it is allowed a Constitution saving throw (DC 20) for half damage.

                        The Shihōin Shield cannot be used again until the next dawn.

                        #### Shiken Hakkyōken (Divine Eight Mirror Sword)
                        Weapon (Longsword), Artifact (requires attunement by the head of the Ise Clan)

                        The Divine Eight Mirror Sword is a unique Zanpakutō passed down from generation to generation within the Ise Clan. The Shinken Hakkyōken takes the form of an ornate medium-sized bladeless sword with a flat end. Its "blade" is decorated with four inlaid diamonds, resembling the design commonly found on the wrapped hilt of a katana, and its forte possesses a tassel on either side. Instead of a tsuba, there is an ornate band guard covering an inch of the blade with tassels hanging from either side of it. The handle of Shinken Hakkyōken is only somewhat shorter than the "blade", and possesses two tassels attached to the ring at its end.

                        **Magic Weapon.** This magic warhammer grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

                        **Random Properties.** The sword has the following randomly determined properties, as described in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:

                        * 2 minor minor beneficial properties
                        * 1 major beneficial property

                        **The Ise Curse**. While attuned, your spouse or significant other falls ill and their body degrades rapidly cutting their life span in half. This effect remains even after being unattuned with the Shiken Hakkyōken

                        **Holy Light.** The sword shines so brightly, opponents are only able to view the hilt. You have advantage on attack rolls on creatures that rely on sight.

                        **Divine Reflection.** Whenever a creature makes an attack roll you can spend your reaction to attempt to reflect the attack. When they make their attack roll, but before the result is revealed you make an attack roll. If your roll is equal to or higher than their attack roll you reflect the attack back to the attacker and take damage. If your roll is lower than theirs, you take half damage. Similarly, When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Additionally, if you failed, all creatures within 40 feet of you also take that damage, no save.

                        \columnbreak

                        #### Substitute Shinigami Badge
                        Wondrous Item, Uncommon (requires attunemnt by a Substitute Shinigami)

                        This special badge is given to a Substitute Shinigami as a symbol of acceptance and license to perform duties for the Soul Society. It allows the Soul Society to monitor and restrict the Substitute Shinigami if necessary.

                        The Badge functions as a Gokon Tekkō, but can only affect the user.

                        The Badge alerts the user if Hollows are within 10 miles via an alarm sound which can only be heard by the owner and the item itself is only visible to other spiritually aware beings.

                        #### Sōkyoku (Twinned Punishment)
                        Weeapon (Halberd), Artifact

                        The Twinned Punishment is a large halberd which the Gotei 13 uses at Sōkyoku Hill to execute Shinigami who have severely broken the law.

                        When not in use, the Sōkyoku is sealed by a number of thick ropes wrapped around its pole, which, piercing the ground, hold the halberd in place. During an execution, the Kidō Corps unseals it, causing these ropes to unwind and shoot off away from the hill.

                        As the Sōkyoku activates, emitting an immense amount of flames, it rises into the air, pointing towards the victim, who is held before it by support beams. The flames, enveloping the halberd, reveal its true form; a massive, phoenix-like entity called Kikōō. In this state, the Sōkyoku’s offensive and defensive power is said to be equivalent to that of a million Zanpakutō. As it pierces the victim, this power increases by tenfold, and creates so much heat it vaporizes their soul.

                        > - **Fire Form.** Any creature that touches Kikōō or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, Kikōō can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. With a touch, Kikōō can also ignite flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried (no action required).
                        > - **Flyby.** Kikōō doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.

                        > - **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Kikōō fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

                        #### Sōshingu (Quincy Bangle)
                        Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement by a Quincy)

                        This old artifact was created to help Quincy with weak Reiatsu, designed to mimic the powers of a Quincy. It forces Reishi to gather, and then amplifies them. In fact, the Reishi will gather even if person using it does not will it. Additionally, it can be used by Quincy to overcome the loss of their powers due to removing the Sanrei Glove. 

                        The Quincy Bangle does have a few technical difficulties while in use. The more powerful arrows take time to get ready, something that would not occur for a normal Quincy Bow, and most of the other arrows have very little power behind them. Also, the Quincy Bangle is fragile and will shatter after a while, sooner when stressed more.

                        The Quincy Bangle has 20 charges, when it is reduced to 0 charges, it is destroyed and crumbles away. If the Quincy Bangle would be reduced to negative charges, it explodes, dealing xd6 force damage to all creatures within 20 feet of it; X is equal to the HD of the user.

                        While attuned the Quincy Bangle provides different benefits:

                        **Depowered Quincy:** Gain access to the following Quincy class features: Quincy Cross, Reishi Manipulation, and Quincy Feats. Additionally, you cannot use a Bow Attribute if you've previously made an attack that turn. When you use a Bow Attribute, you cannot make any further attacks that turn.

                        **Normal Quincy:** Your Heilge Bogen crit range is increased to 19-20 and your Hirenkyaku is increased by 10 feet.

                        When you use a Bow attribute, the Quincy Bangle loses two charges. When you critically strike with your Heilge Bogen, the Quincy Bangle loses three charges.

                        #### Tenshintai
                        Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires attunement by a Shinigami)

                        The Divine Transfer Body belongs to the Onmitsukidō, but invented and tested by Urahara. It is a vaguely Human-shaped, man-sized doll which forcibly materializes the spirit of a Zanpakutō when stabbed by the Zanpakutō. In doing so, it facilitates the user in subjugating the spirit and attaining the Bankai of their Zanpakutō. The materialization can last for three days, after which the spirit reverts into the doll which spawned it. Without this invention, achieving Bankai takes at least ten years, plus the many years of combat experience needed.

                        This method, however, is very dangerous, as normally one would do battle with their Zanpakutō within their inner world, where if they fail, they would not die and can try again. Due to the fact that it forcibly materializes the Zanpakutō's spirit, if the user would fail, they could die. 

                        \pagebreakNum

                        #### Tentōken (Heaven Stepping Adornment)
                        Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires attunment)

                        The Heaven-Stepping Adornment is a brown mantle, with a large drawstring closure at the collar and a large brooch displaying the Shihōin Clan crest. Like the wand, the Tentōken requires no skill or previous experience to use. It is superior to the wand, since it allows one to hover in mid-air, and does not immobilize one of the user's hands.

                        While attuned, you can spend 5 sp any number of times and cast Fly (no components required). The duration lasts for a number of minutes equal to the amount of times you spent 5 sp.
