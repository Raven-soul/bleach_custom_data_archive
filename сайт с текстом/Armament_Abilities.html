            # Chapter 5: Armament Abilities

            <p> Each Armament (Zanpakutō, Heilge Bogen, or Fullbring) has an armament type, usually listed on the items description.

            Armament abilities are spell-like abilities and are considered magical, unless otherwise stated.

            ### Armament Types
            In this chapter you'll find the following armament types:

            Acid, Barrier, Blood, Dark, Earth, Fire, Generic, Gravity, Healing, Ice, Illusion, Kidō, Light, Lightning, Oppression, Poison, Projectile, Sound, Summon, Water, Weapon and Wind.

            There are a few armament types that not all characters have access too. Bow Attributes are only available to Quincy and Hollow abilities can only be selected by Hollow.

            Generic armament abilities can be selected by anyone, and you don't need to have it selected as one of your armament types to pick abilities from this category.

            ### Abilities beyond
            The listed abilities in this book are by no means the only abilities a character can learn. If you desire an ability that is not listed within the book, feel free to speak with your GM on how to incorporate it. 

            The best section to gain guidance for this would be the *Creating a Spell* section in Chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

            ### Saving Throws & Requirements
            The DC to resist one of your armament abilities equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the number of armament abilities you have + any special modifiers.

            For example, Rukia is using her Cone of Ice weapon ability, her other ice abilities are Cold Form, Ice Weapon, and Freezing weapon, therefore the DC would be 8 + 4 (for her proficiency bonus) + 4 (she has a total of 4 ice abilities) total to a DC 16.

            Augments are not counted towards your save DC.

            ### Components
            Just like spells, armament abilities require components. Most abilities require a new component marked with a "W". This notates that to use the armament ability you must have your armament released, unless otherwise stated.

            ### Spell Point Cost
            Armament abilities have an SP cost needed to activate. Each armament ability will list the amount needed.

            ### Ultimate Abilities
            Ultimate abilities are special armament abilities that are usually used as a last ditch effort to win, or turn the tides of a battle. Using one greatly drains your reiryoku and comes at a great cost; usually stated by your class or armament.

            ### Ascended Abilities
            Ascended abilities can only be selected when stated by your class and can only be used while in an Ascended form. Each Ascended ability can only be used once per Long Rest, unless the ability states otherwise.

            * You can reshape the material in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension.

So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick.

            - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 5 minutes
            ___
            A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range.
            The wall is 3 inches thick and is composed of up to five 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be continuous with at least on other panel. Each time you reselect this ability, the thickness is increased by 1 inch.

            If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

            The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. the wall doesn’t need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

            If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

            The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 10 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM’s discretion.
            If you maintain your concentration on this ability for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the ability ends..

            You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
            * Increase the range by 10 feet.
            * This ability no longer requires V or S components.

            hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius. The rubble lasts until cleared.

            If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d8 bludgeoning damage and be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save. If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle.

            The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice) against the ability's saving throw DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.
            Each time you reselect this ability, increase the damage by 1d8..

            You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
            * Increase the range by 20 feet.
            * This ability no longer requires V components.
            * As an action, you instead cause two columns of earth to burst from the ground from two different points instead of one.

            #### Earthquake (Ascended)
            **Requirements:** Six Earth abilities
            ___
            - **SP Cost:** 4
            - **Casting Time:** 1 round
            - **Range:** 500 feet
            - **Components:** V, S, W
            - **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
            ___
            You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. 
            For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot- radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area. 
            The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken. 

            When you use this ability and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone and takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage. 
            This ability can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM. 

            **Fissures.** 

            Fissures open throughout the ability's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens. 
            A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below). 

            **Structures.** 

            The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 20d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.

            You may select this ability a second time, if you do, the number of fissues is doubled, the size of the fissures are doubled and the damage this ability does to structures is doubled.

            #### Bedrock (Ascended)

            This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the life; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.

            This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

            Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all D20 rolls. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

            Restoring life to a creature that hasn't been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. While your armament is reforming, you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks and saving throws.

If a target knows they're using this ability, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

            On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and the Hollow can't use this ability against it again for 24 hours.

            On a failed save, the ability creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. The Hollow can see and hear through the sensor as it they were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creatures that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a small luminous orb.

            | Save Modifier  | Knowledge |
            |:---:|:-----------:|
            |  +5  | Secondhand (They've heard of the target) |
            |  0  | Firsthand (Hollow has met the target) |

            |  -4  | Possession or garment |
            |  -10  | Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like |

            Instead of targeting a creature, the Hollow can choose a location they have seen before as the target of the spell. When it does, the sensor appears at the location and doesn't move.

            You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
            * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
            * You can instead use a bonus action to alter the illusion.
            * You can create images of creatures.
            * You can also create and altar auditory sensations with the illusion.
            * You can also create and alter olfactory sensations within the illusion.
            * You can also create and altar temperatures appropriate to the illusion.
            * You can spend an action to 'program' scripted events your illusion follows, as well as specific conditions that must be met to activate, or change the events. These events continue to loop until the end of the duration, or you program different events. You must have select this ability four times before you can select this option.

            #### Disguise Self
            **Requirements:** One Illusion ability
            ___
            - **SP Cost:** 1
            - **Casting Time:** 1 action
            - **Range:** Self
            - **Components:** V, S, W
            - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
            ___
            You make yourself - including your clothing, armor, weapons and other belongs on your person - look different for the duration, or until you use your action to dismiss it.

            You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

            \pagebreakNum

            The changes wrought by this ability fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this ability to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this ability to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

            To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your save DC.


            You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:

            * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
            * This ability no longer requires concentration.
            * Increase the duration by 1 minute.

            - **Range:** Self
            - **Components:** V, S, W
            - **Duration:** 1 minute
            ___
            Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. For the duration, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which images is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

            Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the ability's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

            If the number rolled is equal to or greaterh than 20 - 8 - the number of duplicates, you may change the attack's target to a duplicate.

            A duplicates AC equal 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, teh duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The ability ends when all duplicates are destroyed.

            A creature is unaffected by this ability if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

            You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
            * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
            * Increase the duration by 1 minute.
            * Increase the amount of duplicates by one, maximum of six duplicates.

            #### Fear
            **Requirements:** Three Illusion abilities
            ___
            - **SP Cost:** 2
            - **Casting Time:** 1 action
            - **Range:** 30 feet
            - **Components:** V, S, W
            - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
            ___
            Choose a single creature you can see within range, you project a phantasmal image of that creature’s worst fears that is only visible to that creature. Each time you reselect this ability the range increased by 10 feet.

            The target must make a Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target’s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d8 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

            You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
            * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
            * This ability no longer requires concentration.
            * You can target an additional creature, maximum 5.
            * Increase the damage by 1d8 to a maximum of 6d8.

            #### Phantasmal Killer
            **Requirements:** Four Illusion abilities
            ___
            - **SP Cost:** 2
            - **Casting Time:** 1 action
            - **Range:** 60 feet
            - **Components:** V, S, W
            - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
            ___
            You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This ability has no effect on undead or constructs. Each time you reselect this ability the cube is increased by 5 feet.

            The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

            The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the ability ends.

            While a target is affected by the ability, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

            An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 4d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area of within 5 fee of the phantasm,

            \pagebreakNum

            provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

            You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
            * Increase the range by 10 feet.
            * this ability no longer requires V or S components.
            * This ability no longer requires concentration.
            * Increase the damage by 1d6.

            Each time you reselect this ability, the cube increases by 5 feet. The terrain’s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

            Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

            The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately.

            A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

            You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
            * Increase the range by 10 feet.
            * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
            * Increase the duration by 1 minute.

While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by this ability.

            Each time you reselect this ability the damage increases by 1d10.

            You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the ability ends. You can end the ability early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or similar magic or ability also ends it.

            You may reselect this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
            * Increase the range by 10 feet.
            * This ability no longer requires V or S components.
            * Increase the duration by 1 day.
            * A creature may take damage more than once each day. You must have selected this ability three times before you can select this option.

            The target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being charmed.

            On a successful save, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the ability ends. On a failed save, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target’s space appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can’t see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the ability's duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.

            You may select this ability a second time, if you do, this ability affects creatures even if they are immune to being charmed and the damage is doubled.

            **Cackle Fever:** Symptoms manifest 1d6 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured.

            Any event that causes the infected creature great stress — including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare — forces the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute.

            The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.

            At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease.

            **Sewer Plague:** Symptoms manifest 1d6 days after infection and include fatigue and cramps. The infected creatures gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured or as stated below, and it regains only half the normal of hit points from spending Hit Dice and when taking a long rest, the creature must spend Hit Die to regain hit points; spent hit dice are then regained as normal.

            At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creatures exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion to 0 or below, the creature recovers from the disease.

            **Sight Rot:** Symptoms manifest 1d6 minutes after infection and include bleeding from the eyes. The creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw, on a failure the penalty worsens by 1. On a success, the penalty is reduced by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal. If a successful saving throw reduced the penalty to 0 or below, the creature recovers from the disease.

            Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.

            **Mage Pox:** Symptoms manifest 1d6 minutes after infection and include vertigo and small blue dots across their body. Whenever the creatures casts a spell there is a 10% chance the spell fails. At the end of each long rest

            \pagebreakNum

            * Reduce the amount of time for symptoms to manifest from a d6 to a d4.

            - **Components:** S
            - **Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour
            ___
            You choose an area of non-magical water (solid, liquid or gas) that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

            * You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for the duration.
            * You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for the duration.

            * vaporize the water or sublimate the ice, which expands to a 30-foot-radius sphere of vapor centered on the water or ice. This vapor is ambient temperature and does not cause damage. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It falls to the ground as water after 1 hour or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. If the environment is Extreme Cold, the vapor turns to snow at the the end of the round and falls to the ground. If the environment is Extreme Heat, the vapor disperses at the end of the round.
            * You condense the vapor, causing it to fall to the ground as water and form a puddle on the ground.
            * You depose the vapor, causing it to fall to the ground as snow and form a patch on the ground.

            If you activate this ability multiple times, you can only have a number of its non-instantaneous effects, equal to your proficiency bonus, active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be pulled 10 feet toward the center. Once a creature reaches the center, if they would take damage, the hit die is increased by one step and they begin to drown.
            As an action any creature within the area can make an additional Strength saving throw, however they do so at disadvantage. On a successful save they are able to move.

            A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

            **Updraft.** You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube’s bottom edge.
            Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall.

            When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.

            Each time you reselect this ability the cube increases by 5 feet.

            You may select this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
            - Increase the range by 10 feet.
            - Increase the duration by 1 hour.
            - When you choose gust, you can choose two different directions.
            - Downdraft also affects non-flying creatures.
            - When a creature ends a fall in an updraft, they take no fall damage instead. If a creature jumps within an updraft, their jump height is doubled instead.
            - You may activate this ability as a bonus action. If you select this option a second time, you may activate this ability as a reaction, but can only select the updraft option if you do so.

            **Requirements:** Five Wind abilities
            ___
            - **SP Cost:** 3
            - **Casting Time:** 1 round
            - **Range:** 100 feet
            - **Components:** V, S, W
            - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 5 rounds
            ___
            You conjure a raging tornado on a point that you can see on the ground within range, this area must be able to fit the tornado or this ability fails. The tornado is a 40-foot-radius, 80-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the

            ability ends, you can use your action to move the tornado up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground.

            The tornado sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren’t secured to anything and that aren’t worn or carried by anyone. A creature must make a Strength saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the tornado or that the tornado enters its space, including when the tornado first appears. A creature takes 7d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top, and takes an additional 7d8 force damage each turn its within the tornado.

            A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the duration ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against the  save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 × 10 feet away from it in a random direction.

            This ability deals damage to structures within its radius. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and pieces of the structure are automatically flung outside the area of the tornado potentially damaging nearby creatures. Any creature within 30 ft. of the tornado's radius when a structure collapses within it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,  the creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and doesn't fall prone.

            \pagebreakNum

            This also increases the damage any creatures can potentially take by 2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 slashing damage.

            You may select this ability multiple times, each time choosing one of the following options:
            - This ability no longer requires V or S components.
            - Increase the duration by 1 round.
            - increase the radius and height by 10 feet.
            - Increase the save DC by 1.

            #### Hurricane (Ascended)
            **Requirements:** Six Wind abilities
            ___
            - **SP Cost:** 4
            - **Casting Time:** 1 round
            - **Range:** Self
            - **Components:** V, S, W
            - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 5 rounds
            ___
            You conjure a deadly and devastating storm that descends from the sky. A 60-foot radius, and 60-foot tall cylinder appears centered on you. You are unaffected by your own Hurricane. The ability fails if you can't see a point in the sky where the storm can descend from (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the storm).

            Within the storm, all ranged attacks and spells always miss their target, being swept away from the raging winds. Vision is lightly obscured, the terrain is difficult, and other creatures have disadvantage on concentration checks.

            Within the storm you have a fly speed of 60 feet and take no damage from the storm itself, however you can still take damage from flying debris, but you have advantage on dexterity saving throws to avoid debris within the storm.

            When the storm appears, small and smaller creatures are instantly swept away from the winds. Medium and large creatures must make a Strength saving throw, on a failed save they are swept away from the winds. Huge and larger creatures must make a Strength saving throw with advantage, on a failed save they are swept away by the winds.
            If a creature begins its turn within the storm they must make a Strength saving throw, taking 10d6 force damage, or half as much on a successful save. If a creature has been swept away by the winds, they have disadvantage on the saving throw.

            These raging winds also deal damage to structures within the area. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and pieces of the structure are swept by the winds increasing the damage creatures and structures take within the storm by 4d6 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 slashing damage. Each structure that collapses within the area further increases the damage the same amount.

            A creature that has been swept away by the storm are flung randomly closer to the eye of the storm, or away from the eye by 4d6 x 10 feet. A creature that has been swept away by the storm can spend a bonus action to make a dexterity saving throw against the save DC. On a success, they can control the direction they move in.

            The eye of the storm is 1/4 the size of the storm and none of the effects of the storm are active within it.

            You may reselect this ability a second time, if you do the size of the area is doubled.

            #### Piercing Winds (Ascended)
            **Requirements:** Six Wind abilities
            ___
            Your Wind abilities are increased in power.

            Your armament abilities or Kido that deal force damage ignore resistances. If a creature would be immune to force damage, it instead takes half damage.
